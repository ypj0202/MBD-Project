Though he died in the early 80s (a plane crash with, I believe, two of his four kids on board), what continues to make Keith Green so mesmerizing for many listeners today is his heartfelt passion for Jesus and the Church. It is an undeniable quality you can hear as he sings and also in the lyrics he penned.\n\nGreen is not the most versatile musician with enormous breath in style. However, what he lacks in scope he makes up for in spades when it comes to his relevancy to most Christians... their fickle behavior... their selfishness apart from the love of Christ... their need for grace and mercy given all the frailties and shortcomings. His music, if listened to long enough, will for some individuals nag at the conscience, for others create a tear-fest, and even bring a few to their knees in prayer. And, it's all because Green sounds genuine, lived a sincere, passionate life for Christ, and had a knack for finding the right words that resonated (and still does) with many Christians.\n\nGiven the current shallow teaching in many Christian circles and the weakness for what is novel, colorful, or vogue over what is true and sensible... the work of Keith Green does indeed remain timely for the current age--especially among Protestant Evangelicals.", "summary": "Heartfelt, Passionate and Funny - Green is Masterful", "unixReviewTime": 1209859200}

It roughly spans his very early music (thus the title), which was a curious mix of \"Jesus\" music and a touch of Elvis Presley, to the pop sound of the late 70's and early 80's. Wielding his tremendous baritone voice like a broadsword, Dallas Holm captured the essence of what young people and others wanted in their music during that fluid period in Christian music history.\nThe later songs range from ballads like I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT OF HIS CARE and A BROKEN HEART, which seem to come straight out of his own heart, to the somewhat playful and rocky JESUS IS A RIVER OF LOVE, and on to the intensity of I SAW THE LORD and the soaring anthem and signature song RISE AGAIN.\nPick this one up. The message it conveys is as valid today as it ever has been and the music is timeless. This CD could have been twice as long. If you can find any of his old LP's or cassettes, I would highly recommend them.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2001", "summary": "Classic Dallas.", "unixReviewTime": 992304000}

Christian albums were worth their weight in gold at the time because there were not that many artists and, as far as we were concerned, couldn't produce them fast enough. One or two web pages would have held the entire collection. But this one was radically different as it was a return to a style of music that, while not completely rejected, was the type that CCM was reacting to. John Michael Talbot's first two albums (CD's today) were of a rousing country rock variety and he was a virtuoso on guitar. But then he dropped out of sight for an extended period of time and, amongst us fans, there was no clue as to what happened. And then...The Lord's Supper appeared and it was unique and, I believe, still is to this day. He consented to an interview with CCM magazine and told us that his wife had divorced him. Understand that in that era, a Christian leader who got a divorce lost a lot of credibility (right or wrong). The interview indicates an extraordinarily painful time for the man. It was a wonderful group of believers that loved him back to spiritual health and he chose Franciscan vows. From that sprang this album and you should know that the entire choir is made up of those people, none of whom had ever sung professionally or even been in a studio. The Lord's Supper is a prime example of God redeeming the moment and JMT opening himself to it. In the ensuing years he fell in love and was allowed to marry (which is allowed in his order) and from that sprang Come To The Quiet. So what am I saying? That JMT has done us the service of allowing his pain, his journey, and his relationship to God play out in his music. As far as I can see, he reintroduced worship music back into CCM as these albums sold as much as ever. It is my hope this gives the reader background for an even deeper understanding and appreciation for the depth and the healing music of The Lord's Supper. As the last words of the last song, beseeching God, say, \"Lord, we are not worthy. ...only say the word, and we shall be healed\".", "summary": "For those who may not know", "unixReviewTime": 1266796800}

His lyrics cover every book in the Bible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke.\n\nThis collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement, which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card's Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gospels will be released in each of the next three years.\n\nCard is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informed imagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the response that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending.\n\nThose who know Card's music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commentary, it's apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane.\n\nHis exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity songs, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song?\"), Christ's birth (\"A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication in the temple (\"Simeon's Song\"). Jeff Taylor's gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together.\n\nAcoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It's relaxed, mature and inspiring.\n\nHe employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental (\"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is not fast, but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives these songs a Celtic feel.\n\n\"The Pain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Christ's followers were not expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of its own.\n\nCommunity is important to Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contribute, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew Ward and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"A Breath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord's Prayer. Matthew Ward's contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Card have been singing for many years, their voices remain strong.\n\nOn \"Freedom,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart's cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciate that he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our freedom. He is the bread and wine. Card doesn't get any better than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply.\n\nIronically, this is the only song that is not directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can make it sound wooden. More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world.\n\nI welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain. It's not hard to appreciate how artful Michael Card is with these texts. Best of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ. He is the way, the truth and the life.", "summary": "Commentary on Luke inspires Card's latest", "unixReviewTime": 1304467200}

This latest album is yet another breath of fresh air from Card.  The lyrics, as usual, are like packing in-depth Bible studies into single tracks.  And as with other Card albums, it grows on you the more you listen and you also gain more insight in to the Biblical truths he is expounding on in lyric.\n\nSome interesting notes:\n-Michael's daughter Maggie is featured on track 2 (\"What Sort Of Song?\")\n-\"Simeon's Song\" (track 4) is an old old song, but Michael has given it a completely new, rhythmic feel and an amazing new guitar arrangement (all other songs on this album are new, by the way).\n-\"The Bridge\" (track 6) is based on the same idea as \"Recapture Me\" from the 1992 album The Word--that the imagination is the bridge between the mind and the heart.  This idea puts Jesus' parables in a whole new light.\n\nThe very fact that I could go on expounding upon this latest album should be reason enough for you to make the purchase--CD, Amazon MP3, or iTunes--just get it!
