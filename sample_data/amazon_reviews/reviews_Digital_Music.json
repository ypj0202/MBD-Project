Wordless vocalizations and forceful percussion propel this song into the stratosphere.  &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, the lead single from this CD, is typical of her earlier fare like &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;, but contains a magic all its own.  The most endearing aspect of this song is its lyrics.  Roma Ryan, Enya's long time lyricist, deserves much credit for her amazing lyrics on this song.  Relax and fall into the images the music and the words make together.  &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is like a hurricane to me.  It begins ominously, like the calm before the storm.  It builds into a frighteningly wicked storm of immense proportions with strings and drums and vocals everywhere. Then, in the middle, it stops, and small lull transpires while angels come down and sing to us.  Then, just as suddenly, the wind comes up again and we are back into the thick of things.  And then, the end comes as suddenly as the beginning.  &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a beautiful ballad which is more lyrical than any other ballad Enya has produced thus far.  In this song, Enya sounds very similar to her sister, Maire Brennan, lead singer of the group Clannad.  &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is another solo piano piece, which embodies the title perfectly.  I can picture myself staring at the wide expanse of the ocean or the land from a high cliff.  &quot;China Roses&quot; is a song of love and a song of the past.  You can feel the slow moving but intensely powerful energy in the undercurrent of this song.  Beautiful synthesized sounds add to the atmosphere here.  &quot;Hope Is A Place&quot; sounds melancholy, like someone has given up hope, and Enya is trying to tell them that it's not too late, it's never too late.  For all in love, hope has a place in YOUR soul.  This is such a sweet ballad with a simplistic arrangement.  &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot; is another instrumental track which embodies its title perfectly.  The sparkling synthesizers and melodies bring to mind a late evening tea ceremony underneath a bright full moon on a late summer's eve.  &quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a soft waltz, a lament, if you will, of something had and lost, here and gone.  &quot;La Sonadora&quot; is the only Enya song to be written in Spanish, and includes some unusual but effective chord changes.  A song to relax by.  &quot;On My Way Home&quot; starts off with a slow organ introduction and moves into a complex bassline as Enya travels on her journey home.  It seems as if your mind walks while listening to this song, with a stop in the bridge as sweet flutes massage your tired mind.  A fabulous way to end a fabulous CD.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Enya Experiments And Succeeds", "unixReviewTime": 978480000, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2001"}

Even writing a review of it will not come close to my inner feelings about its music. The first song, the title track &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, is the most beautiful song I've ever heard. From quiet strings to layered voices and shy piano to an orchestral-sounding climax with percussion and complex vocal parts, this song is gorgeously triumphant. &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; is a catchy but beautiful song that brings to mind wandering through a maze. Another highlight of the album is &quot;Pax Deorum&quot;. The first time I heard it, I thought of a group of hooded figures in a dimly-lit temple performing a ceremony. Enya shows off her low range with this piece. It is also interesting that she combines two different languages with two different religious ideas: the polytheism of the Romans (the Latin part) and the monotheism of the Christians (the Irish Gaelic part). Another tidbit: The Irish Gaelic part in &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; uses the same melody and text as the following, breathtaking piece, &quot;Athair ar Neamh&quot;. Being Catholic (a Christian denomination), I am sure that this song (whose title translates into &quot;Heavenly Father&quot;) has a personal meaning for Enya. &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is also another beautiful but quiet song, an emotion-packed instrumental. Enya certainly proves that you can be very quiet but still display strong feelings. From the joy of &quot;China Roses&quot; to the tranquility of &quot;Tea-house Moon&quot; and the expectantcy of &quot;On My Way Home,&quot; _The Memory of Trees_ is one of Enya's most wonderful works.

Otherwise, the album is nice and has a good variety, ranging from the hushed \"Athair Ar Neamh\" to the lively \"On My Way Home\".

The title track, like many of Enya's beautiful lyrics, simply melts the world's hatred off my soul in a mere ninety seconds.

This was my first Enya album ever, and I'm really glad I started my collection with it.  Out of all of Enya's many albums, it sets a mood the best.  Starting with the breathtaking 4:19 title track instrumental, Enya begins to create a mood of happiness tempered by reflection, so effectively with vocals that are both haunting and joyous along with magnificent instrumentation.  This song then moves to the fast-paced \"Anywhere Is\" (one of two singles off the cd).  \"Anywhere Is,\" may be the most heavily lyrical based Enya single, but she quickly goes through them all, painting a feeling of a journey, of choices made, following a course, and misdirection.  Part of what makes this song so successful is the abundant rhyming; Enya's lively, vital voice; and its rhythm.  \"Pax Deorum,\" five minutes of amazing Latin, certainly sets a mood, with a darker tone.  It's a powerful song, with apparent voice layering, amazing instrumentation, and a very good beat.  The passion of \"Pax Deorum\" segues into the elegance and beauty of the Gaelic \"Athair ar Neamh\" (meaning \"Father in Heaven\").  This song is truly beautiful, with Enya lightly moving through the gorgeous Gaelic stanzas.  \"China Roses,\" which clocks in at 4:47, is a majestic masterpiece, painting a scene with ethereal elements, and has a Utopian feeling about it.  The synthesizer on this piece is quite remarkable, fitting the tone of \"China Roses\" perfectly.  \"Hope Has a Place,\" is romantic, true to life, and, judging from the way Enya sings it, very introspective.  It features some of the grander elements of songs like \"Angeles\" and \"Caribbean Blue\" from Shepherd Moons, incorporating sweeping, drawn out stanzas and peaceful, heartfelt lyrics.  \"Tea-House Moon,\" is playful, with an almost circus like feeling.  \"Once You Had Gold,\" is a serene, elegant and genteel.  Many sections of the song are done in the way you'd expect a lullaby to be done; yet it has more practical application than a lullaby, with very truthful lyrics that touch the soul.  \"La So&ntilde;adora\" is as majestic as it is an auditory delight, especially with the edition of the Spanish lyrics.  The darker feeling in the beginning segues brilliantly into the chorus of voices in the middle section of the song and then concludes with the same feeling of the beginning.  \"On My Way Home\" (the second single off THE MEMORY OF TREES), is an upbeat, happy, and retrospective song that signals the end of the remarkable journey that is THE MEMORY OF TREES.  It's a fitting conclusion to \"Anywhere Is\" and the entire cd.THE MEMORY OF TREES encompasses various themes, various languages, and incorporates stunning instrumentals throughout.  Enya has frequently said she tells a lot about herself through her music, and I think that's particularly apparent in THE MEMORY OF TREES, which, by the end of its 44 minutes, truly moves you.  If it's the first piece in your Enya collection or last, it certainly does not disappoint.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Enya at her esoteric best!", "unixReviewTime": 1007856000, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2001"}

But people with open minds could find there's some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album's title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it's actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It's also a perfect length since it's under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you'd hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There's some songs she does where it's more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song's similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it's a more low-key track but it's also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one's a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it's not technically complex or fast but it's pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There's only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I've ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn't do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it's just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it's another wordless song although it's more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it's a bit more song-oriented. It's different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We're getting into the album's final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it's a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya's more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it's another beautiful track but it's also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it's another slower paced track complete with \"aahs\" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could've benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you'd think it was a bit more upbeat. While it's not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it's still one of her finest outings.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "4.5; music to dream to", "unixReviewTime": 1200528000, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2008"}

Hamlow", "helpful": [62, 65], "reviewText": "Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world.  Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn't it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums, Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There's more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many times I've mentioned this.  Repeated listenings will tell whether it'll dislodge Shepherd's Moon as my favourite Enya album.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Dreamy unearthly magic continues with Eire's one and only!", "unixReviewTime": 1059523200, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2003"}

For certain, The Memory Of Trees is melodic, romantic and sensuous. Roma Ryan's lyrics, sung in  Gaelic by Enya (Athair Ar Neamh), float gently like pillow-soft white  clouds. The compositions are relaxing and harmonious (Tea House Moon),  dreamlike and filled with mystery (Once You Had Gold), and include subtle  touches of Celtic tradition (Enya's phrasing on `Hope Has A Place'). The CD  is a quiet and lush alternative to ninety-percent of the popular music on  the market today, and also a welcome substitute for the often hectic pace  of daily life. Enya's arrangement of the compositions on Memory is well  thought - the comparatively dramatic and uplifting `Anywhere Is' and `On My  Way Home' are placed so that the listener doesn't fall asleep.However,  I'm very leery when I read a dozen reviews of a particular musical release,  and all the writers rate the artist's work with five-stars. My hesitation  is not a matter of taste (listeners are free to condemn or rave about  whatever they please), but one of perspective. Is The Memory Of Trees a  musical ground breaking effort? Does it introduce a unique technique or  significantly alter a current genre of popular music? On close listening,  the electronic pseudo-symphonic music of Memory does not approach the  beauty or dynamics of an orchestra with real people playing real  instruments. Nor does Enya's multi-layering of her own voice have the same  rich sonic texture as a chorus comprised of real voices. Then again,  perhaps The Memory Of Trees (and all of Enya's work) is so provocatively  ethereal because it is surreal.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Have You Hugged A Tree Today?", "unixReviewTime": 959385600, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2000"}

I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece.

Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is, in my opinion, her best to date.There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and Enya is certainly a new age artist, but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers. And if you look at what is being released these days, many groups are ripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an ok job of copying Enya, but don't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find.What makes this a 5-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know. I know this sounds ridiculous, but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music. Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music, it works even better when it's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful.Many artists/fans are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table, but I am always very appreciative when the final product does not sound like it was manufactured by an assembly line, but rather reflects a balance of the artist's intent with the listener in mind.Thanks for reading and I would like to thank ALL reviewers as their opinions (even when I disagree) give me clues as to what I may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artists who I may have missed if it were not for work.

But for her to have essentially taken the crown of this genre implies a depth to her music, and this is very evident on \"The Memory of Trees\".Enya's first few albums were good, but there was something missing, something that had yet to be developed. I'm not entirely sure what that intangible \"something\" was, but she certainly found it on this one. The title track is an instrumental masterpiece featuring her trademark layered vocals (though no lyrics to speak of), and it reminds on of a clear fall day. This sets the pace for the record, which is decidedly autumnal. 'Anywhere Is' is about the maze that life's choices put us into, while 'Pax Deorum' features few lyrics (all in Latin) that reverberate almost like a dark stormy night that eventually settles into a calm drizzle. 'Once You had Gold' is as delicate as a falling leaf, and 'On My Way Home' brings back memories of weekend trips home from college, traveling through the gorgeous foliage and dizzying scents of fall.If 'Only Time' defined her \"A Day without Rain\" album, it's 'China Roses' that defines \"The Memory of Trees\". Enya has crafted a lullaby-like soothing piece of moonlight that is instantly calming. It's easily the best piece of the record and, even nearly twenty years after the album's release, it still stands firmly, refusing to sound dated in a genre that, at one point, relied a little too much on synthesizers.It's been over fifteen years since \"The Memory of Trees\" was released, but it's a still favorite when it comes to Enya's music.

I love the two songs \"China Roses\" & \"Hope Has A Place\". Very beautiful songs. \"Pax Deorum\" is a very epic sounding song and quite a neat piece of music. I'd love for Enya to explore this kind of musical landscape again. She does this kind of thing so well! \"On My Way Home\" is an excellent \"Orinoco Flow\" sounding, up tempo close to the CD.Also, this was my first Enya CD so it also holds sentimental value to me. Ever since I've listened to this album I've been a die hard fan of Enya. Many people call this elevator music or boring.

Little in the way of innovation.I find in reading reviews of her music that reviews fall into several categories. The lemming reviews, are those by devotees who blindly accept any of her offerings with equal fervor. The musical snobs, who castigate her work as being unsophisticated and trite. The newbies, who are hearing Enya's work for the first time and think the latest (their first exposure to Enya) is the be-all, end-all. And then there's me, the nostalgic, offering what I feel is an objective take on how a CD ranks in an artist's overall repertoire. That said, Watermark is pure genius, the best album of the last twenty-five years. Shepherd Moons is also brilliant, though inevitably a notch below its peerless predecessor. TMOT continues the slide, dipping into mediocrity, territory that Enya had never before chartered.

Enya is the partnership formed by Eithne Ni Bhraonain (Enya herself), Nicky and Roma Ryan.  Born is Donegal, Ireland, Enya studied classical music under private tuition until she was discovered by producer Nicky Ryan.  Along with his wife Roma, the trio grew into one of the most notorious musical talents of the New Age era.  Personally, I find Roma to be the most impressive one of the three, as she is responsible for writing the most beautiful lyrics in almost any language one can expect (she has her own website and it is a true testament to creativity with style - do pay a visit).This CD includes songs in English, Spanish, Latin and Celtic.  The rhythms are light and airy, befitting a body of work allegoric to nature.  My favorite song is \"Anywhere is\", with exquisite lyrics by Roma Ryan about the continuity of time and how we always seem to be at its mercy - \"I might be just beginning, I might be near the end\" sings Enya at the closing of the song.  The Spanish-written \"La So'adora\" tells of the fleeting passing of the seasons through the perennial life cycle.  There are also instrumental songs like \"Tea House Moon\", which I can perfectly imagine as background music during a Japanese tea ceremony.The album design is exquisite, with Enya wearing a royal blue velvet robe created by Elizabeth Emanuel exclusively for the photo shoot, which makes her look like an eternal Celtic goddess in her golden throne.

Like on my birth certificate it says my first name is Jeffrey.  Well, I chose for myself a \"musical name\" and for several years now, it has been the title track to this album \"The Memory of Trees\".

Enya's voice is like that someone's voice singing, as they held me up.  A love, much more complex and wide-ranging than just romantic love, breathes out in this song.

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"", "helpful": [12, 13], "reviewText": "The problem with Enya is that she is so consistently good.  It is difficult to write a review that says something different from previous reviews (having recently reviewed \"A Day without Rain\" and previously \"Watermark\").  The same words, ethereal, ephemeral, airy, haunting, and spiritual apply to each album.  The only risk is that my reviews become boring, because Enya could never be.This CD begins with the instrumental track \"The Memory of Trees.\"  While \"The Memory of Trees\" is nominally an instrumental, there are voices that punctuate portions of the music.  This opening feels optimistic, though the title feels as though it is vaguely related to forests and lands gone by.  The vocals provide a chorale sound that builds and cascades around you with the feeling of great trees and landscapes greater than any of the puny works of mankind.  Great beasts wander about and smaller beasts enter and exit the brush at the edges of clearings in the great forest in a celebration of nature.The pace speeds up in the peppy \"Anywhere Is.\"  The lyrics are poetic and symbolic and are a mirror maze of mental images.  As is frequently typical of Enya the lyrics seem to make sense until you attempt to understand them and then their meaning escapes your grasp.  In this case the song seems to be describing the paths we take in life and the choices that we make, and whether they can be unmade, and even whether the choices take us to or from the one we love.  Another unusual feature of this song is the predominant instruments which compete for attention with Enya's voice.  Typically Enya's voice stands out clearly from the instruments, which in this case are mostly strings and piano.\"Pax Deorum\" is somewhat ominous, and fits with the following song, \"Athair Ar Neamh.\"  Both songs are simple songs that relate to God.  \"Pax Deorum\" translates roughly as \"The Peace of the Gods,\" or seeking to placate the gods.  \"Athair Ar Neamh\" translates approximately as \"Father in Heaven.\"  Note that the title of the latter song appears as a line in the former song, tying both songs together, and placing an Irish Gaelic line into a Latin song.  There are moments of choral lightness in the otherwise ominous \"Pax Deorum,\" which I believe has appeared as the background music for a commercial.  The latter song is more contemplative and ethereal and Enya allows the beauty of her voice to caress and harmonize the Irish Gaelic verses.\"From Where I Am\" is a relatively sedate instrumental that forms a brief piano interlude leading into \"China Roses.\"  This song manages to capture the wonder of the universe and the beauty of heaven all in one song.  This song transcends the poetic to the surrealistic both lyrically and vocally.  Once again Enya allows her voice to be a beautiful instrument to complement the strings and piano to create a work of aural art.\"Hope Has a Place\" is the first song where the lyrics are relatively easy to understand.  The concept is simple: there is always hope where there is love.  The vocals are beautiful (again) and may remind a listener of the song Enya wrote for \"The Lord of the Rings.\"  This song is for romantics and candle-lit dinners everywhere.Another instrumental interlude follows.  \"Tea-House Moon\" has some of the most interesting instrumental effects on this CD.  The mood is contemplative and traditional, though with a vaguely Asian flavor.  This instrumental is the music for a heavenly choreography.The next song changes style, again, and yet fits within the character of the album.  \"Once You Had Gold\" seems to allude to the transitory nature of all things, perhaps most particularly life.  There are lines that seem to say that things come and things go, and you need to accept the joys that you can get just from being here to greet the new day.  I particularly like the last line which says that there are no promises in life, that there is good and bad and that one must make the best of any situation.  The song is sung in a fairy tale style, a cautionary tale young and old.The next song translates as \"The Dreamer.\"  The music tells you all you need to know about the words, which are surrealistic and, of course, dream-like.  The ephemeral lyrics and music bespeaks an atmosphere, a feeling, a place that can only exist in our dreams, though we might wish otherwise.

Except where noted otherwise, each song is sung in English.Enya is one of the best composers and performers I know to unwind with; another in this category is Ryan Miller, who composed the soundtracks for the video games MYST and RIVEN.\"The Memory of Trees\" (instrumental and voices, no lyrics) Waltz tempo, opening with electronic keyboard, joined by piano. Enya joins in vocally but without words partway through. The main theme is about six notes long, continually repeated with variations. One of my two favourites on this CD, ranked only after \"China Roses\".\"Anywhere Is\" Unusually staccato for Enya, mainly string accompaniment. No percussion, some piano. The lyrics are very distinct and easy to follow except during the chorus, when the louder volume of the accompaniment and softer singing obscures the words a little. (\"You go there you're gone forever / I go there I'll lose my way / if we stay here we're not together / Anywhere is\").\"Pax Deorum\" (sung in Latin) Noticeably deeper pitched-chorus and accompaniment than usual. The accompaniment includes some percussion, in this case base drum, although the beat is mainly carried by the keyboard.\"Athair ar Neamh\" is sung in Gaelic, with very quiet keyboard accompaniment so that Enya's voice carries the main lyrics very clearly. During the chorus, a multiple-track arrangement wherein she appears to sing with herself blurs the effect a little. Very clear and bell-like, on the whole.\"From Where I Am\" (instrumental only) Specifically piano. As usual with Enya, her piano solo here makes me think of water imagery.\"China Roses\" Waltz tempo again, opening with electronic keyboard, but most of the accompaniment is covered by piano. \"I know that if I have heaven / there is nothing to desire; Rain and river, a world of wonder / may be paradise to me.\" Most of the verses contain a reference to heaven, the night sky.\"Hope Has a Place\" I would tentatively call this waltz tempo again, but it's very slow, and the beat isn't quite regular. Enya's singing comes through very clearly herein (except for the more complex choruses, as usual). The accompaniment consists of very simple chords on an electric keyboard so as not to drown out the singing. The refrain is \"Hope has a place in a lover's heart.\"\"Tea House Moon\" (instrumental) Unusually electronic feel to the keyboard carrying the melody in this one. Doesn't seem typical of Enya's work.\"Once You Had Gold\", 'once you had silver / Then came the rains / out of the blue. / Ever and always, / always and ever,\" with the refrain \"Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.\" Waltz tempo again, almost a lullaby in this instance, Enya's singing dominating the piano and keyboard accompaniment with a wordless chorus.\"La Sonadora\" - Sung in Spanish, very drowsily, waltz tempo again. The quiet accompaniment is primarily voice with some very deep string, with organ joining in after a couple of verses.\"On My Way Home\" - Opens with organ accompaniment, as in the later part of the previous song, but then switches to a very staccato keyboard accompanying Enya's singing. \"On my way home / I remember / only good days.\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "11 tracks", "unixReviewTime": 1114473600, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2005"}

The rest of the album seemed a  reflection of this, and as with 'Watermark' it was a generally cheery  collection.
