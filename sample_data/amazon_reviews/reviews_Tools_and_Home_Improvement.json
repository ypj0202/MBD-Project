Traditional tank style water heaters use 3/4\" NPT (tapered thread) connectors. The problem is bridging these incompatible thread types without a leak.\nIf you call SioGreen support, they will tell you to use brass 1/2\" female NTP to 3/4\" male NTP adaptors. This will work on the inlet side, because the plastic nipple sticking out of the water heater is soft, and will conform to the tapered thread of the adaptor. On the outlet side you must connect the supplied stainless steel flow control valve to the water heater outlet. When you then try to thread on the brass adaptor (tapered threads) to the stainless steel flow control valve (straight threads), it will start binding at about 1/3 of a turn. After futzing with this for a couple of hours, I was finally able to get a good seal by using lots of teflon tape and severely over-tightening the adaptor.\nThere should be an easier solution than this.\n\nFollow up - I've got it installed and working without leaks. It seems sufficient for a bathroom sink or shower, if you take miserly showers. Don't expect to fill a bathtub with this thing.

I said this was a temporary fix until we get our gas line hooked up.  We're converting all our appliances to gas. But I might just leave this unit there since it works so well.

Garner", "reviewText": "I had this IR260 unit for around a month before I was ready to install it.  I had a little trepidation about whether it would provide enough warm water for my application (small cabin, 2 sinks, one shower) but forged ahead and had no issues with the installation process.  Following the directions exactly, I turned the unit on and opened a sink faucet.  To my delight, warm water soon came out.  But the real test came when the shower hookup was complete and I went to try my first warm shower in the cabin.  This time, I got even more warm, actually hot, water and had to turn the shower down towards cold a bit so it wouldn't be too hot.  This unit is perfect for a small cabin or home with just one or two people using hot water.  The unit takes up so little space and I found it nearly a snap to install.  If you get one of these, make sure you turn the faucet hot water handle all the way on until the temp stabilizes before backing it off.  If you turn it on just a little, you'll get a \"beep beep\" from the unit indicating that there is a \"flow restriction error\" - what this means is there is not enough water flowing through the unit.  A leak anywhere in the system will cause this error to show as well - I found this out from having a screw cap at the end of the hot water line; the male adapter threads had no teflon tape on them so it leaked, hence the \"beep beep\".\n\nOn standby, the unit shows a \"4\" where the temperature usually is displayed - it would have been nice to know this beforehand as it is nowhere in the literature that came with the unit.  At first I was wondering what kind of problem or error this might be.  Perhaps a less confusing display for standby mode would have been \"SB\" and including this in the manual or instructions would have cleared everything up anyway.", "summary": "Easy endless hot water, in the shower, too!", "unixReviewTime": 1489363200}
