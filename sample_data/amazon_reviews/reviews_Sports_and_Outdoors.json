Over the years I've collected these gazetteers for quite a few states, and they've come in handy when exploring out-of-the-way places, as I'm fond of doing. For me, this atlas proved most useful when driving around and hiking in the Adirondacks. I was able to find ways to get to some remote areas, thanks to the fact that the maps show secondary roads and backroads, and also show hiking trails. Because the maps are topographical, I have a pretty good idea in advance as to the sort of terrain I can expect to encounter, particularly in the hillier and mountainous territory. While I've used this mostly as a guide to the Adirondacks, it also appears that it would be quite useful in exploring other parts of the state because of the detail it shows.", "summary": "Great for exploring the rural parts of the state", "unixReviewTime": 1470009600}

I would be driving thru at least 6 states and wanted to have a hard map on hand for planning purposes.  While I will have a Garmin GPS unit running, I do like having a manual backup - just in case.  I also like having a map so I can spend an hour the night before reviewing the route and perhaps looking for side roads to adventure.  The beauty of this retirement road trip is that if I see a road leading off into some unknown distant hills, I am free to go.  Trying to get a feel for the terrain ahead or where interesting waypoints along the way on a tiny GPS is impossible.  Having an actual map makes it so easy to look for alternate roads, forest service roads in the mountains, and possible stops.\n\nNow that I'm home, my Atlas & Gazeteers are full of circles, scribbles, notes, and arrows.  They got a lot of use.  Even sitting at a rest stop, quite often other travelers would come up and ask me for directions to some place they're looking for.\n\nThe only downside to these maps?  Small print and I have old eyes.  I brought along a magnifying glass to read it better.  My bad luck to forget it at a rest stop and not realize it until I was 700+ miles away.

And so, a few years back, when I knew we were going to be in the greater Phoenix area and were then heading to the Grand Canyon, I figured I would make sure I had an Arizona atlas so I could see more than just what I could observe from the major highways. With this Arizona gazetteer I discovered backroads that aren't found on a regular roadmap, hiking trails and trailheads, and other points of interest.

So, when I headed to Arizona to combine a visit with my daughter in the Phoenix area with a trip to the area around the Grand Canyon I made sure I had a gazetteer with me. Like the others I have, this one proved invaluable. I was able to discover backroads that aren't shown on the typical roadmap. Plus, I was able to locate hiking trails and trailheads, thus allowing me to fulfill another passion while on my visit.
