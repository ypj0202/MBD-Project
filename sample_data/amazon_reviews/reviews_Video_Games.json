But, if you've dabbled in Empire Earth, AOE, Age of Mythology, and enjoy these economy based warfare games, definitely give ANNO 2070 a shot.\n\nThere is a learning curve, particularly if you are a newcomer to the series.  Essentially, this game is about meeting the needs (food, drink, belongings, entertainment, community, etc.) of your citizens, which become increasingly demanding as they rise from the ranks of common workman to something equivalent of CEO.  With their progression brings higher taxes income, yielding a stronger economy capable of building and supporting an impressive military.  Warfare is not necessarily the focus, or even the majority of the fun, in this game, but it still gives the option for ship, submarine, and aerial combat, with several units of each type available.  You can even go nuclear.  It's pretty sweet.\n\nThere are three \"races\" of people.  It's a bit like Starcraft in that they can each build their own units, and have their own specific needs.  The first group is the ECOS - they are the liberal hippy tree huggers who care only about thee environment, and turn unhappy if the ecobalance becomes too polluted.  The 2nd group, the TYCOONS, are the seal clubbin' oil drillin' conservatives who care only about making money no matter the cost.  Finally, you have the TECHS, a faction only concerned with technological research.  The TECHS are featured moreso in the expansion (ANNO 2070: Deep Ocean), but are still important for development of ECO and TYCOON needs as they advance.  I highly recommend the expansion if you play this and find you like it - it adds so many new ways to develop your cities.\n\nI love this game.  I've always been a fan of city builders, but this one (like ANNO 1404) has really drawn me in.  I've put in weeks worth of hours on it and am still playing.  The campaign missions are fun, but the real joy lies in a continuous game.  Once you are comfortable playing, you can spend literally hours on a hard continuous game with 3 AI players, a pirate base, and a warship hellbent on your destruction.  It is still a challenge even after playing for over a year.  I think a lot of what makes it fun is that no two games are ever played the same way.  There are different ways to power your city, different upgrades to utilize, different ways to destroy your opponents.\n\nA quick note about DRM: It sucks that this game must be played with a constant internet connection.  There is a multi-player faction, but honestly I've never even tried it.  Single player is what I enjoy, and there's no reason to be online for that.  Still, I give it five stars, because the game itself warrants it IMO.", "summary": "If you like RTS games, check out ANNO 2070", "unixReviewTime": 1368403200}

And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series.\n\nAt first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal.\n\nMuch like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.

But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie.\n\nAs a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations.\n\nI would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game.\n\n==================================================================\n\nWow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!!\n\nI am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?!\n\nIntuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense!\n\nYou want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory!\n\nThe graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO.\n\nSuch a shame, such a shame.

What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did.\nLength of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game.\nStory - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad.\nOverall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay.\nCharacter dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at.\nHand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good.\nCons:\nOMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it.\nGraphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues.\n(Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints.\nSheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals.\n\nProfessional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons.\nSniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over.\nAll in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower.

Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.

Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.\n\nI think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.

I bought the DVD version because I didn't want to deal with downloading on slow internet, but I see similar issues reported on steam forums.  I buy games on Amazon or Steam because I don't want to deal with the hassle of pirating.  I thought it wouldn't be worth the time, but this game makes me have second thoughts.  This game was not worth the time, and I've yet to be able to actually play a full race.\n\nIt took two evenings from when I got home from work until after midnight just to get this game installed.  I wanted to try playing video games, so I bought a computer and some games.  The installation takes hours, crashed my computer multiple times, required many dependencies (like \"MS games for windows live\") that must be installed separately.  The only way to find out you need this other software is to search the forums... If you don't have some dependency, after an hour of waiting the install finishes but the game doesn't start.  I even had to edit XML configuration files to get the program to start at all.\n\nThe game can't be played unless I am *both* logged into xbox live *and* have the DVD in the drive.  I find that DVD's scratch easily, I consider them transfer media not a reliable way to store data.  Since they already have the DRM of a mandatory windows-live service, I don't see why they would cripple the game even further with the disk requirement.  For this reason, if you ignore my advice, at least get the downloadable version.  I'll probably copy the dvd image to disk as an iso with CloneDrive, but it's an extra 7gb of data that has already been installed on my hard disk for a game that... can't be played anyway.\n\nOnce I finally ironed out the installation issues, and was actually able to get the game started, 2 minutes into each attempt at a car race the entire computer would crash.  Black screen, unresponsive, numlock doesn't even change the lights on my keyboard, needing a hard-reboot.\n\nI know some will assume I just don't know how to install software, or that I have an old computer, or that I have viruses.  I'm a software engineer with over a decade of software development experience.  All of the other games I bought on Amazon or Steam worked fine (including one other that also required the windows live service).  My computer is two weeks old and fast, i5, 8gb of ram, a discrete graphics card, nearly brand new.  Even if this was a resource issue, the game shouldn't consistently crash my entire computer to the point of needing a hard reboot.  The price for the game isn't high, but don't waste your *time* on the PC version of this game.\n\nIf you're a young kid and you've got all of your summer vacation to play around with figuring out installation issues, maybe this will be a good learning experience for you.

Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.

There is absolutely no relationship to driving this \"car\" to anything in real life, other than when you step on the gas it goes forward.\n\nIn actual rally driving you use throttle steering to actually steer the car; its the defining quality of racing on dirt.  To do that you need to be able to keep the steering wheel straight, and use the brake to shift weight forward and back to control car rotation. But in the game the car is impossible to steer straight going 5mpg on a straight road, let alone hit racing speeds.  I tried every single possible controller setting, and even bought a brand-new wheel. Both had the same problem: turning the wheel 5 degrees results in the steering inputs reacting as if I turned the wheel 10, or 15, or 20, or 30 degrees depending on the speed.\n\nThe only workaround I could find was the \"dead zone\", making the wheel inoperable while centered, and then it violently overracts when turned outside of the dead zone.  Using that I could steer straight and then sharply turn, then go straight, then sharply turn.  Ridiculous, yes, but if you watch videos of people driving on youtube.com that's how the game was apparently designed.\n\nYou'd think that a driver-oriented game would have a multitude of options for the most important aspect of driving: controlling the car.  Instead, the game is horribly slowed down by useless eye-candy graphics and a ridiculously obtuse interface.  Just starting the game and getting to the point of driving a car takes 10 minutes while you frantically hit the enter key trying to tell it to skip the fancy graphics and storyline and get on with the darn game.\n\nIf its racing you want then iracing.com is still the only realistic option.

There are a number of different vehicles to unlock in each vehicle category and the tracks range from asphalt to dirt to snow, some mixing the various terrains in a single course. If anybody has played any of the Colin McRae Rally games, or naturally any of the previous Dirt games, they should feel right at home* (see Cons for *).\n\nThe game basically has the player build up his fame to gain more sponsorships and be invited to tournaments and open new seasons. In the first season you are shown all terrains types and give the opportunity to learn gymkhana (~stunt driving~).\n\nThe graphics are polished and high quality, especially on the vehicles, and engine audio is up to par.\nGameplay is fairly straightforward, yet quite entertaining. Smashing your and opponent's vehicles is a ton of fun and damage modeling is well done.\n\nIts just fun to drive and crash in the game. The game is very \"modular\" and can be picked up to play for just a short while or you can go all out and spend hours and hours.\n\nCons:\n\nGameplay can get repetitive, and even if the type of event is switched nearly every other race, you get to replay the same tracks, a number of times in different events (which are \"different\" really only by name).\n\nCar feel is somewhat bland, most cars in the same group feel very similar or nearly identical, the biggest difference you will feel is the stopping distance increase with more horsepower of the car. By contrast, this also makes it weird when a car actually behaves quite differently than the others, such as Ken Block's car or the Original Mini Cooper.\n\nIn conjunction to the above, car handling is a bit weird at times, might be me, using a keyboard, but, during a normal dirt rally stage, you pretty much cannot recover from a real handbrake turn. Not sure if it is because of car tuning or abs still on (abs should not matter, but it's the only thing I have on) but once the car's back-end has slid around past say 20 degrees off center, the slide is irrecoverable. Does not matter if you apply full opposite lock, does not matter if you break, accelerate, or just let go of the gas pedal, does not matter what type of turn it is (shy of a hairpin), your call will keep sliding in the same direction, potentially getting more sideways, until you crash or slow down to 10 km/h (6mp/h).\n\nGames for Windows Live - whenever you see this logo, be afraid, very afraid! In Dirt 3, you will HAVE TO have or create a Windows Live account, or you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAVE THE GAME. Or play online for that matter. This is just some crappy DRM scheme and I was quite sad to find out about it, as this, plus having to always have the dvd in your drive, makes just booting the game an annoyance. Once all is set up, its not that bad of a hassle, but still, why punish players that buy the game?\n\nThe menus and animations, and introductions will drive you up a wall. The are cool the first 100 times, -_- , not allowing me a way to skip them is just cruel. You will notice this the most when you enter a race: unskippable animation to show you your car, 1 second pause, menu pops up with \"Race\" and \"Mod car stuff\", etc, and then another 5 second animation to show you your car again, but on the starting grid, 1 second pause, and then its time to race, 3 second countdown till you can actually drive. Also every time you select an item from the race menu (those triangle things) again, animation, 1 second halt, here is what you ordered, oh new selection, sorry that need another animation.\n\n* People that were used to the Colin McRae games might be wondering where real rally went in the game. The one with the stages, and having to spend time in between races to repair damage, having to complete a few stages of a race with a half broken car. The special feeling of being part of the WRC is mostly gone. Now most races are on the short side (they do get longer as you progress), can be restarted at any point and no previous-race progress is lost, and even more there is the rewind feature. Naturally you do not need to use these mechanics, but just being there spoils the mood.\n\nOther Thoughts:\n\nIt may seem like I slammed the game pretty hard, but then gave it a strangely high mark. The point is that the game is good, quite good, despite all the above issues, which all in all are actually fairly small things. Plus the cheap price bumps it up a notch.\n\nYou will want to immediately turn off all assists (keep the driving line and abs at first, then decide for yourself) else the car basically drives itself.\n\nThe loss of a true rally mode may be a make it or break it deal for somebody. The game is really fun, the driving is very fun regardless of the issues stated above, yet you will miss good ol' Colin.\nI would have given the game 3.5 out of 5, just because of the great stuff lost over the years, but I realized that it was not fair to compare it with something that (unfortunately) it is not anymore.\n\nFor $12 it's a great deal.", "summary": "Great driving game with a few blemishes", "unixReviewTime": 1345075200}

I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with.\nI have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends...\nDirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off.\n\nAs I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing graphics\n- Amazing physics\n- Challenging but entertaining races\n\nCons:\n- Gymkhana\n- Interface\n\nWhat went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck.\nI saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No!\nRacing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.\n\nNow, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss.\n\nConclusion:\nAs far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today.\nIf you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!\nIn spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.", "summary": "A 5 stars winner!", "unixReviewTime": 1318982400}

Good luck.  I have a typical Windows XP system with an nVidia video 8600 series card and 4GB ram.  Decent but nothing tricky. I am also quite resourceful and capable of doing things like \"deleting .dll files\" running special installers from third party websites, etc.\n\nYOU MAY VERY WELL NEED TO BE AS WELL.\n\nIf your install does not work and the game gives you and error, you may be on your own.  Codemaster's tech support?  Responded twice total. I spent another $30 on a registry and .dll fixer, nothing, then they told me to uninstall a bunch of other stuff I had on my machine and then when I did, wouldn't return my response that their help did not resolve my problem.  Poof, gone.\n\nThere is no phone number and their home page is on Facebook.\n\nSo I used Google and found their official forum and posted a lengthy message with the details as requested by their forum guide and got NOTHING, no help.\n\nI was able to eventually get it to run through more Google searching for related problems in other games.  Problems that should not exist in today's games.  I had to download and run special installers from a sound card manufacturer and \"drill into\" the Dirt 3 game folder and delete a specific file.\n\nHow stupid is this?  And nothing?  No help?  No FAQ?  No fix or patch?  Even more remarkable is that their forum is filled with demands that Codemasters fix the bugs.  Demands for many months now, apparently gone unanswered, literally.\n\nThis IS THE FIRST AND LAST CODEMASTERS GAME I will ever buy or help someone with.\n\nI gave it one star for the horrible \"welcome aboard, have fun installing\" for this game and \"one star\" for game play as it has been a week and countless hours spent, with no help from Codemasters, getting it to run, which is not much \"fun.\" So One star for fun.\n\nIt now works, maybe I'll come back and reassess my fun score, maybe not.\n\nGood Riddance.", "summary": "Install Failure, No Tech Support GOOD LUCK!", "unixReviewTime": 1316908800}

I assume they either can't replicate the problem or just don't care. Lacking any help from Codemasters, I've tried the various fan fixes, including uninstalling Rapture 3D.

Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it.\nI was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.\nIt is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case.\nI am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.", "summary": "awesome game, if it did not crash frequently !!", "unixReviewTime": 1315958400}
