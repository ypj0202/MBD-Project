If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.\n\nThis gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.\n\nThis also does not frustrate me in the ways too many other books and guides do.\nHere, Leapman uses the symbols common in knitting magazines and most books on knitting you've seen. Yay!\nOne of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches. Alice Starmore leaps to mind as a woman living in her own private Idaho filled with her own Runic symbols. I have to translate her every chart's cable squiggles into the symbols I'm more familiar with just to get the thing going. Gorgeous end results, but geez.\n\nThis is concise but full of options, so I FIND something nifty quickly and easily.\nWhile I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.\n\nUntil that happens, this is my new go-to for fast, interesting ideas to enhance my knitting.\n\nThis is not a great resource for traditional knitting stitch patterns, such as gansey (guernsey), it's perhaps best for 'modern' classic knitting.", "summary": "My current favorite go-to guide for inspiration", "unixReviewTime": 1439337600}

Having a photo of each is really great, too.\n\nMany of the stitch patterns look as nice on the wrong side as they do on the right side; and for those stitches the author puts a symbol to easily identify them.  She also includes photos of both sides of the knitted swatch to show the differences.\n\nFor the stitch patterns that have a \"no thinking necessary\" wrong side row (e.g., knit all the way across or purl all the way across on wrong side rows), she uses an \"Easy\" symbol for quick identification.\n\nThe one thing that would have made it a 5-star book (in my opinion) would be if there had been some sort of yardage requirement.  Although it's understood that you can use any weight yarn for these stitches, the sample swatches were all knit with Cascade 220 yarn, provided to the author by the Cascade Yarn Company (as acknowledged by the author).  She doesn't state whether it was the superwash version of the Cascade 220 or not (and I think it wasn't), but both are a worsted weight.  So, if she had simply put something like, \"the 4\" x 4\" swatch of this stitch used 20 yards of yarn,\" it would be helpful.  With that information, you can get a good ballpark figure of how much of a DK weight yarn (for example) that you would need for a baby blanket using that particular stitch.  Obviously, this wouldn't be necessary/helpful for all of the stitches (such as the Diamond Openwork Panel) but for the stitches that might be used for the entire body of a baby blanket (such as Sevignac Lace or Graceful Leaves) it would be incredibly helpful.", "summary": "Wish I could show that I give it 4.5 stars, not just 4", "unixReviewTime": 1436400000}

Yes, there are old favorites here, but the depth of new stitch techniques and ideas of how to work them into patterns has really helped to round out my large, huge, library of stitch encyclopedias. While some lace is covered, it is not a huge book of lace designs. The world has many. They are needed, but I don't make much lace. If you want reverse stockinette, cables, texture and strong fabrication, this is a great book.\n\nAll patterns are charted, as well as written and the colors tabbing the section make sense. There is little on, \"how to do basic stitches,\" taking up page space. While that information is important, I find the redundancy of the simple knit and purl to be a tree-wasting effort to round out some books, which would be better off without them. If you cannot knit, nor purl, perhaps this is not the book to start with. Which is fine! It's part of the journey of knitting. There is no end to this road of interest and there should not be, Texture, working patterns into garments and general beauty with color photographs, that are not over-the-top, but show the finished pattern in good light, are the hallmarks of this book.\n\nIf you knit can you exist without it? Well, of course. If you want to get a book with stitches I've not found elsewhere, then this is a must own. So much so, that after buying the edition for my Kindle, I got the book. I can't leave an entire sticky notepad's worth of paper in my Kindle. I can in the book and that's what I've done to this book. It sits in my pile in my studio space, within reach at all times. Right next to my Barbara Walker books and Vogue stitch dictionaries. I use it daily and make up swatches often, just to get a feel for them and to learn. Anyone who wants more will find this book a great resource. This is all my own thoughts.

The pattern book is broken down into different sections: cable patterns, slip-stitch patterns, lace patterns, etc. Maybe I shouldn't, but I found myself comparing the book to Barbara Walker's stitch pattern books. One of the things I love about Walker's books is that she tells you if the pattern will roll, lay flat, if it's stretchy, if it's good for a sweater, a scarf, etc. If Ms. Leapman had included some of that information with each stitch pattern, I would definitely have given this 5 stars.", "summary": "Good, but...", "unixReviewTime": 1389398400}

I used to participate in a Civil War\n\nI am very much a novice seamstress. I used to participate in a Civil War Reenactment troupe, resulting in me needing to learn how to create period-correct clothing (or pay the exorbitant fees for clothes from specialty vendors). After buying a sewing machine (see the review for my current machine here), I have primarily learned how to sew through trial and error.\n\nIn an attempt to earn extra cash, I decided to make doll clothes to sell at the county fair. After breaking out my sewing machine, acquiring cloth, notions, and various embellishments, I made a doll skirt. At that point I realized just how rusty I was- I don't think I could've made a more crooked seam if I tried. I immediately logged onto Amazon and made use of my Amazon Prime membership: within two days I held my copy of Teach Yourself Visually Sewing.\n\nAllow me to explain the reason behind my purchase. I am very much a visual learner; reading a paragraph of instructions without pictures (or even minimal pictures that may not necessarily cover every step) renders me down to the learning function of a monkey attempting calculus.\n\nAfter reading other customer's praise for this book, I clicked the button to purchase it.\n\nI cannot begin to explain adequately just how great this book is. I learned more about sewing within a half hour of reading than I learned over the past six years.\n\nDebbie Colgrove's writing style is very informative while remaining simplistic (a sewing pun!). This is not to say that she writes as though the reader is an idiot, rather, she takes the time to explain concepts without cluttering up the book with sewing terminology. Too many other teaching books make the assumption that people know the \"lingo\" for their topic; Ms. Colgrove will only do this after she has defined each word she introduces.\n\nThe pictures within the book are also excellent. For each lesson, there are step-by-step photographs which clearly show what you should be doing with your fabric. The accompanying sentences for each picture are concise and well-written, which enabled me to learn new sewing techniques quickly and easily.\n\nIn addition to providing step-by-step instructions for various sewing techniques (basting, flat-felled seams, French seams, & etc.), Teach Yourself Visually Sewing also explains what I term your craft-specific \"knowledge base\". What this means is she takes the time to show the reader how to read patterns, how to properly cut cloth, the difference between types of cloth and thread, and much, much more. In short, this is like explaining the why for a what. Not only do I now know which needle to use for heavier fabrics, I also know why you need to use that needle. By teaching the reader the \"why's\" for everything, you will be more likely to retain what you have read.\n\nThe book also includes several projects that you can attempt, ranging from a novice skill level to much more advanced. The patterns include things such as a hostess apron, pillows, a receiving blanket, a table runner, and more. Each project is also illustrated to ensure that you are completing each step successfully.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nTeach Yourself Visually Sewing is an indispensable tool for any skill level. The information contained within this book will have you sewing straighter seams, cutting cleaner lines, and more, within a matter of hours. I will even go so far as to say that every sewing aficionado should have this book in their arsenal as a reference material (again with the sewing puns!); I feel that there may be no equal.\n\nThis book, to my opinion, is better than even the \"Idiot's Guide\" and \"For Dummies\" line of books. With those series, there are not many pictures and simply a lot of text trying to teach you [sometimes] really complicated concepts. Teach Yourself Visually Sewing provides clear, full-color photographs and wonderful written explanations for each.\n\nIn short, if you are serious about learning to sew, have sewing as a hobby, or only sew when you need to replace a button, this book is a must-have. Like me, you will find yourself consulting the book frequently to ensure that you are doing everything correctly, or to brush up on a step. This book is simply the best value for your money!", "summary": "A Stitch in Time", "unixReviewTime": 1279238400}

I had heard the word since childhood from my mother and other elders but didn't know what it meant other than something to do with a bed cover.  I liked what I saw on Ravelry so I went searching for more information.\n\nI found this book and knew I had to have it.  I think I will have to do a lot of practicing to get good at the squares, but they don't seem too difficult.  It looks like it might take a long time to make a counterpane, but would be well worth it.\n\nInterestingly enough on page 2 there was a reference to a collection of Atoinette Lackner Webster from Eat Poultney, VT.  I have Webster relatives from VT.  I don't know if she is related but I wrote to the Poultney VT Historical Society and found out that Tony is deceased and they didn't know where her collection was but they did know a friend of hers and hopefully I will some day hear from the friend.\n\nIf you like knitting and want a challenging, fun task, try a counterpane.

Until now (as a fantasy buff) I only knew one name in the world of cross stitch, Teresa Wentzler, but I am pleased to say that I've found another one just as talented, Joan Elliott.\n\nWhen I received Bewitching Cross Stitch in the mail yesterday I was flat out stunned at the quality and complexity of the designs Joan Elliott created. The showcase designs are simply gorgeous, awe-inspiring. Her designs look like painted stitchery, not cubist interpretations. They are sometimes whimsical, other times hauntingly beautiful, always lovely. Even better is the fact that, while I'm not a big stitcher myself, she includes petite pieces and coordinating projects out of each design that are small and simple enough for the beginner to attempt (and actually finish).\n\nStandout projects include the Father Sun, Mother Moon, the dragon from the cover, and the black cat/magical workshop. The cover of this book does NOT do it justice, the dragon pictured there is covered in tiny details and fine stitching.\n\nLastly, as a Pagan, I was pleasantly surprised to see the Wheel of the Year pillow and the celestial faces. The only thing missing is a Green Man face, now THAT would be gorgeous given the same treatment as the others.\n\nAll in all, a great book for those who like fantasy and magical designs. I think it's worth every penny, on sale or not, and will definitely recommend it to my likeminded stitching friends.", "summary": "Stunning Stitchery for the Magical Needle", "unixReviewTime": 1231804800}
