Yes, we actually enjoy dishes from many countries.  Of course, we do have a natural affinity to Spanish and Latin-American cuisines.  The Santa Fe style of cooking, an amalgam of Spanish, Native American, Mexican, Southwest, and New Age cuisine has always intrigued us.  When we want to \"kick it up a notch\" on the hot and spicy meter, we like to cook Mexican food.  And we love tacos and freshly prepared salsas.\n\nA new book from the Santa Fe School of Cooking has re-energized our taco skills and given us a new appreciation for the flavors of the Southwest.  We especially enjoy the variety of inspired salsas -- everything from roasted corn and Anasazi bean to cherry pistachio.  For our Cuban audience, the grilled pineapple and grapefruit-orange salsas are right up your alley, offering flavors and a heat level that isn't far removed from Cuban cuisine.\n\nTwo taco recipes really knocked our socks off:  Hot and Smoky Shrimp Tacos and Roasted Wild Mushroom Tacos with Queso Fresco.  Not classically Mexican, these fusion dishes really deliver some unique flavors.  We were also delighted to find a recipe in the book for apple pie tacos -- again, we never saw this one in Mexico, but what a great idea for dessert!\n\nSalsas and Tacos is a nice little book in a beautiful package with enticing photographs and easy-to-follow instructions.  A perfect gift for the food lover and at this price, why not buy several and make several people happy?\n\nAlso recommended:  \"Three Guys From Miami Cook Cuban\" and \"Three Guys From Miami Celebrate Cuban.\"", "summary": "Fresh and Tasty Ideas from Santa Fe!", "unixReviewTime": 1144713600}

He does argue, however, that Trailin' - one of Brand's early westerns - warrants reading (and I agree) as it vividly illustrates Brand's almost magical, archetypal western that was so popular in the years before World War II.\n\nThe setting in Trailin' is vague and uncertain, and apparently this is typical of Max Brand's stories. We only know that it occurs somewhere in Brand's mythical west. (Contrastingly, Louis L'Amour's geography and landmarks were carefully researched.)\n\nBrand's characters are nearly as mythical as his geography. The hero in Trailin', Anthony Bard, overcomes all obstacles to track the killer of his father across the open plains and mountains of the wild west. Bard's success is especially remarkable as he had no prior wilderness experience, having been raised in a wealthy setting in New York.\n\nHis cold, calculating adversary, Steve Nash, is a classic villain, one who even resorts to killing Bard's horse. The action-packed plot had some unexpected twists, but ultimately the ending seem contrived, revealing a secret that could have been disclosed much earlier.\n\nMax Brand was one of the many pseudonyms of Frederick Schiller Faust, creator of more than 350 westerns in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nToday, classics like Shane, The Big Sky, The Virginian, Lonesome Dove, The Ox-Bow Incident, and Monte Walsh as well as L'Amour's popular fiction largely overshadow Brand's novels.  Nonetheless, despite a notable lack of verisimilitude, Max Brand's action tales offer enjoyable, light reading for fans of westerns.", "summary": "Trailin' - Good Introduction to Max Brand's Mythical West", "unixReviewTime": 1119052800}

Disappointingly, Williams works in very little of the character development seen with Jacen in Traitor. Only once was Jacen's \"VongSense\" utilized during this story, and it nearly directly contradicted another scene earlier in the novella. Jaina also suddenly doesn't seem to use her \"Trickster Goddess\" repertoire anymore, which was a little disconcerting.\n\nSome of these seemingly minor discrepancies seemed a little troublesome while reading, and are probably the only drawbacks to the story. Timing may have a lot to do with it, however, as most of Destiny's Way had been written over a year ago, possibly before Traitor had gone through its final draft (publishing deadlines and schedules are strange sometimes). However, I will give the benefit of the doubt to Mr. Williams as--I believe--this story was written after Destiny's Way was completed, and is but a small part of the overall story. Being small in page count doesn't leave room for a lot of character development, I'm sure. The rest of the story easily makes up for the few minor problems, though.\n\nMildly impressive was the overall length of Ylesia, which is most likely equivalent to about seventy-to-eighty written pages of text. The story flows well, and never really drags on. Verbiage was also quite good with no particular over-usage to any noticeable effect. Classifying it as outstanding fiction would be difficult, but calling it good writing is not. If this eBook is any indication, Destiny's Way should be worth the money for the events contained within, but not necessarily for an earth-shattering reading experience.

The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.\n\nYleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.\n\nFor the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.

Their solutions are fact-based, rigidly structured, and hypothesis-driven. Facts bridge the credibility gap. Hiding from the facts is a prescription for failure.\n\nMost McKinsey-ites are generalists, knowing a little about a lot of things. On the first day of an engagement, all team members comb through stacks of articles and internal research to gather enough facts to illuminate their piece of the problem. Every document (including internal memos), presentation, e-mail, and voice mail produced by a McKinsey-ite is supposed to be 'mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive' (MECE).\n\nWhen generating an initial hypothesis (IH), you don't need all the facts, just enough to have a good overview of the industry and the problem. The essence of the IH is 'Figure out the solution to the problem before you start.' To structure your IH begin by breaking the problem into its components - the key drivers. A good McKinsey issue list contains neither fewer than two nor more than five top-line issues. Next, make an actionable recommendation regarding each driver. Then consider what issues it raises, and the likely answers to each. Then down another level. The end product is the 'issue tree.' IHs produced by teams are much stronger than those produced by individuals.\n\nClients are often no better at diagnosing themselves than a doctor's patients. The only way to determine this is to dig deeper. The biggest obstacle is politics; sometimes change management means changing management.\n\nMcKinsey teams often make frequent use of an analytic framework called Forces at Work. This involves identifying the client's suppliers, customers, competitors and possible substitute products, listing the changes occurring in each, and the likely impact these could have on the client.\n\nThe 80/20 rule is one of the great truths of management consulting. Eg., when a client asks the question \"How do I boost my profits?\" the first thing McKinsey does is take a step back and ask \"Where do your profits come from?\" The answer to this is not always obvious. The 'Elevator Test' is knowing your solution so thoroughly that you can explain it clearly in 30 seconds. P&G tells its managers to write one-page memos, a Hollywood producer will tell a screenwriter to 'give me the bullet' on a new script - if, after 30 seconds, the producer likes what he's heard, the writer will get a chance to talk further. If you have a lot of recommendations, stick to the three most important and don't worry about supporting data - you can talk about that when there is more time.\n\n'Pluck the Low-Hanging Fruit.'  Seize those opportunities. They create little victories, boost morale, and give you added credibility. Clients can get very impatient for a result during the six months (or more) that a big engagement can last. Try to write down, or chart, every day to summarize what was learned.\n\nEngineers learn something called the Square Law of Computation - that for every additional equation in a problem, the amount of computation required to solve increases at least as fast as the square of the number of equations - unless you make some simplifications.\n\nIn the business world, you're better off consistently hitting singles than going for the home run and striking out a lot. McKinsey pounds the concept of professional integrity into associates from their first day - one important aspect of that is honesty, which includes recognizing and admitting when you haven't got a clue. Conversely, don't accept 'I have no idea' from others - probe, ask a few pointed questions.\n\nMcKinsey sells without selling - it waits for the phone to ring. It markets - eg. producing a steady stream of books and articles, invites and gets a lot of coverage by journalists, encourages partners to participate in 'extracurricular activities' such as sitting on the boards of charities etc., addressing conferences, occasional meetings with former clients.\n\nMcKinsey relies on teams - any entity should when facing complex problems. Team-bonding activities are a given - going out at least a few times to the nicest restaurants or to see a show or game. A little goes a long way. A typical McKinsey team works at the client for 10 - 14 hours/day, plus a day over the weekend at the office. On out-of-town studies, team members will eat together more often than not. Talk to your team, and make certain they are happy with what they are doing. Don't be constantly changing course. Treat them with respect, get to know them as people.\n\nMake your boss look good. Don't reinvent the wheel - look at the reports of prior similar studies, talk to those involved in the prior studies. Look at annual reports - starting with the 'Message to Shareholders.' Look for outliers - eg. the best and worst salespeople, and why. Look for best practices.\n\nBe prepared for interviews - write a guide. Start with general questions and move on to specific ones. Don't dive right into a sensitive area like 'What are your responsibilities?' or 'How long have you been with the company?' Include a few to which you already know the answer - gives a sense of their honesty and/or knowledge. Have the interviewee's boss set up the meeting - this tells the interviewee that the interview is important. Interview in pairs. Listen, don't lead - ask open-ended questions. Paraphrase. Always write a 'Thank you' note.\n\nConduct team brainstorming.\n\nResist the temptation to tweak your presentation right up to the last minute - there are diminishing marginal returns to doing so. Walk all the players at the client through your findings before you gather them into one room.", "summary": "A Structured Approach to Consulting", "unixReviewTime": 1459641600}

The McKinsey Way on the one hand gives an account of the work that the consultants at \"the Firm\" perform. On the other hand it describes the character and corporate culture of the world's most prestigious management consultant firm. Unfortunately everything is held at a very basal level. The book cover slightly speculatively reads \"Penetrate the McKinsey mystique and learn the secrets\" - very little is however revealed. Ethan Raisel is a former McKinsey consultant who also has worked as an investment banker and an equity portfolio manager. For this book he interviewed a large number of former and present McKinseyites.\n\nThe book doesn't attempt to describe any of the strategy models used by the Firm but instead gives practical advice on how to handle the actual project work done by the consultants when they have been called in to deal with a business problem at a client. This includes topics like putting a team together; forming an initial hypothesis of the art of the problem and its solution without anchoring on this hypothesis if facts should point in another direction; performing interviews; searching for facts; doing research; breaking up problems into solvable parts; brainstorming; how to handle communication within the project group; with your boss and with the client; how to prepare an effective presentation with good graphs; selling without selling and above all - how to make sure that the work that is performed focuses on the few key performance indicators that most of all relates to the assignment given by the client.\n\nIt's all sound advice but as all topics are covered much too briefly the text at times turn into clichs like \"if you make your boss look good, your boss will make you look good\" - true, but seriously... The one chapter that packed a good punch was that one on conducting interviews. It's very useful and also slightly longer relative to the other chapters. The techniques are pretty much the same as for another inquisitive group of persons, journalists. The author states that the purpose of the book was to try to give everybody tools to become more efficient in business. Even if the book is thin on details and the processes in many ways may seem obvious, this doesn't mean that that they are widely followed in business. By being disciplined in using good practices the Firm gets a head start compared to many others.\n\nThe text reads 178 pages which sounds like a fair amount but the font is big and there is a lot of white space so the reader will finish the book in no time. In some ways it's almost like a children's book on strategy consulting project management.\n\nThe corporate culture at McKinsey sounds strikingly similar to the one on the corporate finance departments at investment banks. It's the same type of 3 - 6 months of project work, the same pride in working all-nighters and weekends and the same pitching to clients who pay outsized bills. They both have flat organizations, fact based meritocracies where anything that brings results is considered regardless of whom came up with it and also relatively young persons are given heavy responsibilities. You even find the same type of informal hierarchies where those who bring in the large bucks turn into superstars. It's a white shoe elitist culture built on superior intelligence and forceful execution. People who work under intense pressure form strong bonds and if you're a top student from a top university and routinely is called in by high powered CIOs at Fortune 500 companies as a savior it's no wonder these bonds are built on the feeling of superiority.\n\nWhatever your opinion is of The Firm, McKinseyites take some hugely valuable assets with them when they leave it. They have received an unshakable confidence that any problem can be solved if you just break it down into pieces and analyze it rationally; they get a stellar network of alumni's and a feeling of being special. No wonder so many make top positions.\n\nThis is a review by investingbythebooks.com", "summary": "Much too brief", "unixReviewTime": 1374278400}

Millennia ago, during the late Bronze Age, the king of Athens was forced to send seven youths and seven maidens to Crete every nine years.  There they were left in the dark maze of the Labyrinth to become victims of Asterion, the Minotaur son of the Minoan king.  One year, the Athenian king sent Theseus, his own son, to Crete among the sacrificial levy.  Theseus gained the love of the Minoan king's daughter, Ariadne, slayed Asterion and escaped with the other captives, Ariadne, and her younger sister Phaedra.\nNow Ariadne was pregnant with a daughter by Theseus and he had become infatuated with Phaedra.  So Theseus abandoned Ariadne and his unborn daughter on the island of Naxos, saying that it would be too dangerous for her to sail on and that he would return from Athens after the child was born to take them to his home.  When Ariadne objected, Theseus claimed that he was only doing the will of the gods and sailed off with his his paramour to Athens.  In her anger, Ariadne plotted vengeance against the entire Aegean world, gods as well as men, and used her powers as Mistress of the Labyrinth to initiate the destruction of all the labyrinths except one.  Since these labyrinths had been used to magically trap all manner of evil influences to protect their cities, corruption and destruction soon began to spread throughout the Aegean.\nAfter launching her curse, Ariadne sailed away from Naxos to the far distant island of Albion.  In the following years, disaster after catastrophe destroyed cities and crops and lives throughout the Aegean as the labyrinths failed.  Finally, the Aegean world was wracked by the ten year Trojan War, spreading Trojan refugees throughout the known world.\nIn this novel, 98 years after the fall of Troy, the Trojan Kingman Brutus, son of Silvius and heir of Aeneas, is visited by the seeming of the goddess Artemis and told that he is destined to build Troia Nova on the island of Albion.  First, however, he must complete a task to prove his worthiness.\nCornelia is a fifteen year old dreamer who has decided on a certain youth as her future husband.  When this youth is slain by Brutus and then Brutus takes her in marriage by force of arms, Cornelia screams her hatred and starts to plot against the Trojans.  When that plot and other efforts to oppose Brutus fail disastrously, Cornelia blames herself for the lost lives and her spirit is broken.\nIn this story, the Trojans sail to Llangarlia on Albion as victims of a great scheme by the great-great-granddaughter of Ariadne to reconstruct the Game (or labyrinth) of Troy upon the Veiled Hills above the banks of the River Llan.  She is the only surviving Mistress of the labyrinth and Brutus is the only surviving Kingman.  Together the two can rebuild the Trojan Game and Brutus will sacrifice almost anything to gain that power.  Strangely, however, he can't quite sacrifice Cornelia.\nThis story is rich in ancient Greek and British allusions and nuances.  The many details of ordinary life in those societies make the tale convincing and immediate.  One finds oneself vicariously living among these characters and participating in their lives.\nThe story nicely weaves the myth of the Minotaur with other Greek and British myths.  The author tells us why and how the Aegean world self-destructed.  Moreover, she tells you the real story of the city of Llanbank on Albion.  Just when you thought you knew the truth, this novel comes along to confuse you once more.\nThe story does include some rather explicit sex and sexual cravings.  Moreover, the relationship between Brutus and Cornelia has more than a hint of sado-masochism, but may be fairly typical of those brutish times. This relationship is nicely contrasted with such bonds within the matriarchial Llangarlian society.\nThis novel does move somewhat slowly at first.  One is almost tempted to look ahead to see how it will come out.  Moreover, the author has interspersed scenes from pre-war London prior to the Blitz to further tantalize the reader.  Just when the story is beginning to really move, however, it terminates;  although it will be continued in God's Concubine, one hates to wait.\nRecommended for Douglass fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of ancient societies and magic.", "summary": "The Fury of a Woman Scorned", "unixReviewTime": 1070668800}

Of course, as mistress of the labyrinth, she leaves a backdoor for herself and her female progeny--a way in which to recreate the game in a future time and reclaim her power.  Approximately 100 years later, Ariadne's heir Genvesa is all but ready, however she needs a King man to help her dance the mystical powers of the game back into being and forever trap Asterion in the center of the maze.  Trojan Brutus, adept at the game, is her man and through a series of ploys and adventures, Genvesa lures him from Greece to the misty land of Albion--the southern portion of the British Isles.  One crucial problem arises to snag Genvesa's plans when Brutus impulsively takes Cornelia, the daughter of a conquered king, as his wife and drags her along on his quest for the promised land of New Troy. In Albion, Genvesa has all but destroyed the old god and goddess that ruled the island.  When the Albion mother goddess, Mag, Genvesa's chief foe, hides within Cornelia, Genvesa's plans to reconstruct the game are almost permanently foiled.\n\nAs you can imagine, this tale is long and fraught with the machinations of all characters who seek either self-preservation or the heady power of pure domination.  Douglass cleverly combines many myths to support her premise and to bring alive the baser natures of her creations.  However trite, there is sex, gore and raw emotion galore, so much so that I found myself wincing with disgust at many of the too descriptive passages enlightening the reader to scenes of birth, death and utter savagery.  The characters seem to be intentionally crafted as archetypes like the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece rather than real fleshed out personas. Brutus lives only for the power of kingship and possession of Genvesa.  Cornelia, raped and torn from her family and country, somehow improbably forgets her grief and yearns for love from her brutal husband.  Genvesa connives with a hallowe'en witch's malevolence while the rest of the cast are simply not finely drawn enough to not be categorized as either good or evil.  All characters are either blighted with trite dialogue or overly long-winded emotional explosions.\n\nBottom line:  While the story will keep your attention, none of the characters are subtle enough to capture your emotions; they are stylized shadows which at times fail to elicit much response other than a shrug and a turn of the page.  The literary style fails to recreate a feel for ancient times, rather it attributes modern day sensibilities to otherwise primordial savages.  I don't know if I will read the second volume of this trilogy unless I could again listen to it while I engaged in something physically challenging.", "summary": "\"Des\" Troy Game", "unixReviewTime": 1055116800}

Wow, what a revelation -- I'm sure that opens everyone's eyes! He spends the early part of the 'book' (that is a generous term here, the text might fill a 50 page deliverable, at best) discussing the importance of hypothesis development and issue trees. All fine, except this is consulting 101 -- every consultant gathers initial facts, develops potential rationales for the issues a client might face (or an hypothesis), then goes off to see if their thoughts are correct, and finally develops go-forward recommendations.\n\nRaisel stays at such a high level throughout the book, that there is no way to get beyond the pleasantries of 'base your conclusions on facts,' and 'adjust your hypothesis based on new facts.' Instead, he sounds like a washed up high school athlete most of the time -- recounting war stories, eating chinese food at the office, and working until 2am every night! This all gets old pretty quick, though he tops it off with chapters on how to travel (bring a sweater for long flights!) and how it's a good idea to carry on your luggage to save time at the airport.\n\nI really don't see how this book stays in print, but I do understand how Raisel only lasted 3 years at McKinsey -- this sort of supercial blather is just the sort of thing that McKinsey despises.", "summary": "Nothing new here, just a McKinsey fluff piece", "unixReviewTime": 1310774400}

Within ten years of writing his first book on McKinsey, entitled \"The McKinsey Way,\" Rasiel has witnessed \"the Firm\" double its number of professional consultants to 9,000, and increase its number of locations by almost 20% to 89 offices globally. McKinsey continues to thrive in up and down markets that included the tech bubble bursting, 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the worst economic recession since the 1930's. If you want to join this illustrious firm, then according to Rasiel, getting hired is simple:\n\n\"Be of above average intelligence, possess a record of academic achievement at a good college and a top business school, show evidence of achievement in all previous jobs, and demonstrate extraordinary analytical ability. [And] If you manage to clear all those hurdles, the key to joining the Firm may be the case interview\" (p. 161).\n\nBut you don't have to work for McKinsey to benefit from applying its approach to your own business problems. The cornerstone for getting inside the McKinsey mind is the MECE (pronounced \"me-see\") mantra - an acronym that stands for \"mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive.\" And this doesn't refer to the hours you'll be working as a consultant. Although they will also be mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive!\n\nThe process begins once the client comes to you with a problem. You must first dissect the problem into its simple constituent parts. For example, if the client says, \"We need to make more money,\" then you should immediately respond, \"Well, how do you currently make your money?\" When the client answers that they make money by selling product X, then the obvious question becomes, \"How do we sell more of product X.\" Next, to make this initial root question conform to MECE standards we exhaustively look at ALL the factors that might effect sales of product X, including production costs, distribution channels, and marketing. Then, re-phrase the question(s) into \"action statements.\" For example, \"We can increase product X sales by: reducing our unit costs, changing the way we sell to customers, and improving the way we market to customers (this construct can be teased out further by constructing an \"issue tree\").\n\nOnce organized into this framework, we can form our initial hypotheses on how to solve the problem(s). Finally, we test our hypotheses by verifying them against the facts (\"trust, but verify\"). Facts trump all else. Ethan Rasiel warns us, \"Hiding from the facts is a prescription for failure - eventually, truth will out\" (p. 5). The McKinsey system relies heavily on the availability and accuracy of these facts, some of which are gathered through its proprietary \"PDnet\" system - a collection of recent \"client engagements,\" and internal research & publications (\"The McKinsey Quarterly\"). Such an analytical framework that breaks propositions down into their \"atomic facts\" would make the logical positivists of the 1920's that occupied Oxbridge very happy.\n\nHaving studies philosophy during college, it seems that a background in philosophy would be great training for being a consultant, because you must be a generalist, yet also possess the analytical ability to delve into the nitty-gritty. Rasiel quotes one Engagement Manager who said, \"You have to be fundamentally skeptical about everything\" (p. 2).\n\nAnother feature of McKinsey that can benefit other organizations is their \"free-flow of information\" philosophy that is nurtured through a lateral hierarchy. While there exists a clear pecking order: Director of Client Services (DCS), Director, Partner, Senior Engagement Manager (SEM), Engagement Manager (EM), and Associate, McKinsey adopts an open-door policy. You MUST keep others \"in the loop.\" Sometimes the best ideas come from your teammates, Rasiel advises, \"Keep an open and flexible mind. Don't let a strong initial hypothesis become an excuse for mental inflexibility\" (p. 21). There will be times, however, when even the best ideas (no matter who comes up with them) just cannot be implemented for the client due to \"political reasons, lack of resources or inability.\"\n\nRasiel also discovered several other useful rules while working as an associate at McKinsey (from 1989 to 1992) that might help you. For example, for some unknown reason the 80/20 rule - that 20% of the work is responsible for 80% of the results - seems to apply to many facets of life, including business. As alluded to earlier, it is also important to consult your co-workers, rather than have to re-invent the wheel. And if you're chatting it up with your EM, then you better be familiar enough with the client solution to be able to articulate it in the 30 seconds it takes to ride down in an elevator with him. A final useful point to remember is that on your quest to discovering the holy grail (big picture) be sure to go after little victories by \"picking the low-hanging fruit.\" While you don't need to work at McKinsey to develop this analytical frame of mind, the Firm is filled with such people, and the lessons are universal in their application.", "summary": "McKinsey Trilogy (part 1 of 3)", "unixReviewTime": 1252627200}

I picked up the book in a thrift store, thinking it was a one-shot, and was instantly captivated. The book has a compelling story and interesting characters, nicely entwined with Greek mythology and history. Interspersed within the third-person writing are personal insights into one character--my attention always perked up when \"Cornelia Speaks.\" Also tantalizing are the glimpses into the \"future\"--1939, with all the primary characters somehow still present. Love (and more love), betrayal (and more betrayal), hatred, destiny, fate, the kitchen sink--there's dollops of most of what makes a good story here. And then it ends (without really ending).\n\nThe following installments leave behind everything that made the first iteration noble, stooping to petty bickering among the remaining cast. Names change regularly, with a number of similar names thrown in just to add to the confusion, and (semi-spoiler alert!) not everyone is who you've been told they are. The pace also slows dramatically--especially in the concluding tome, where almost nothing plot-relevant really happens until well near the middle of the book.\n\nSo if you want a good read, you can do worse than \"Hades Daughter\"--but you'll be regretting your choice for your next three reads.", "summary": "Don't start--You'll be sorry!", "unixReviewTime": 1303776000}

There was action, blood, guts and gore, which helped the book pick up pace for me, but then sometimes the book bogged down in unnecessary detail.\n\nThe main characters of the book are not in the least bit perfect, and that, I think, saved the book.

The Minotaur teaches her the dark magics he learned at the center of the maze and helps her destroy The Game and the labyrinths all over the ancient world.\n\nWithout The Game to trap evil, the ancient world falls into disrepair. Plagues, droughts and volcanic eruptions kill thousands. Everything Theseus touches is poisoned, including Helen of Troy, his lover, resulting in the Trojan War. The Gods become powerless and fade out of existence.\n\nBut Adriane has deceived the Minotaur and left one labyrinth intact. Her great-great-great-great-great granddaughter picks up where Adriane left off and seduces the heir to Troy, Brutus (now a vagabond and mercenary) in an attempt to reactivate The Game and make herself the most powerful woman alive. She knows that whoever controls The Game, can control the world.\n\nThe result is novel that leaps from ancient Greece to pagan Britain and back again. The plot twists and turns as each character tries to gain the upper hand in a deceitful battle for a power that none of them really understand, making the novel a suspenseful, ancient soap-opera.\n\nThe truly fascinating thing about this book is that it's based, to an extent, on fact. There really was a Trojan Brutus who invaded England in 1100 B.C. Many of the characters mentioned in this novel are real historical figures.\n\nThis is the first of a four book saga, so Douglass does leave some loose ends to hopefully be tied up later. Douglass's only big flaw is not giving the reader a hero worth cheering for. All her characters are self-serving (although some for causes they truly believe just) and willing to stab their best friend in the back. They're fun to read about, but you wouldn't want to have lunch with them. Hades' Daughter is definitely fun historical fantasy, but it can't hold it's own against the better plotted, more fleshed out worlds of George R.R. Martin or Jacqueline Carey. Still it's worth the read and the $7.99.", "summary": "Ancient Myth and Magic", "unixReviewTime": 1111881600}

Even Douglass' Wayfarer Redemption series (which I found amazing) was covered with fingerprints of Tolkein and other fantasy writers.  The themes were familiar: hero of forbidden heritage with never before equalled control of power, prophecy directing events...etc.  What made the Wayfarer books rise above other fantasy novels was that Sara Douglass' plotting is unparalleled.\n\nIn the Troy Game, her control of plot is at its mind boggling best.  She directs events that span over decades and lifetimes.  Do not even try to predict what comes next at any point!  Sometimes, the character development is hijacked by the plot (characters act in a way that seems unwarranted to move forward events), but this is rare and also a tiny foible because her storytelling is so rich and multilayered.  In addition, frequent fantasy readers will be delighted to find themselves in new territory.  The magic, the characters, the plot developments are all Douglass' their own.\n\nIn conclusion, this book is highly recommended.  Sara Douglass' tendancy to put her protagonists endure or perform heinous rapes or physical abuse is jarring and readers wishing to have someone to sympathise with could get frustrated.  However, Sara Douglass is writing with different priorities from other fantasy authors.  Her greatest gift is the very fact that there are no clear good and evil characters (except for Asterion), Brutus and even Cornelia perform repugnant actions and the best course is to just lose oneself in the tale and repress that impulse which wants novels to depict a moral ideal.", "summary": "truly original", "unixReviewTime": 1110931200}

Rasiel is a very easy-to-read, somewhat informative, but ultimately uninsightful book.  I think persons interested in the consulting industry would benefit the most from this book.  Nevertheless, as a business book in a general sense, most of the material is rather fundamental.  In other words, if you purchase this book, I would caution against doing so with lofty expectations.\n\nMECE\nWhen the folks at McKinsey examine a problem their client is having, they develop a Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive list of issues to bring clarity to the problem under their analysis.  The MECE list is to be concise, intelligible, and generally contain no more than three items.\n\nELEVATOR TEST\nAs a general rule, whether you're finding conclusions for a client or generating proposals for a new project, you want to employ the elevator test.  The elevator test is simply the ability of being so prepared and thoroughly researched that you can explain yourself and your position comprehensively in thirty seconds.  I think in business there is a lot of truth to this elevator test.\n\nTEAMS\nI think the author appropriately emphasizes the importance of team bonding with dinners, movies, ballgames, and so forth.  I think the reason why McKinsey functions so effectively as an organization is that its teams function exceptionally well, and that is perhaps a result of the numerous bonding opportunities on the company's dollar.\n\nCONDUCTING INTERVIEWS\nI actually found the section on how to conduct interviews to be fairly useful.  If you are a researcher, perhaps even a journalist, and a portion of your job involves conducting interviews, I do not think you would waste your time reading this section in the book. However, read it closely.\n\nWHY THREE STARS?\nI believe many of the ideas presented for the reader's applications, as typical with consultants, are idealistic.  That is, the methods and procedures covered in the book are not always feasible or pratical for an organization to implement.  Furthermore, the book did not provide the insights I was perhaps looking about the company.  I think, one perhaps would hope, the author had a lot more information he could have provided his readers.  I think the author actually hints at the above point.  Furthermore, I think some advice is actually harmful, particularly on achieving work and life balance with taking work from the office to the home with you.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you are a consultant, considering becoming a consultant, or plan  to hire a consultant I think you might find this book to be of some value to have a concept of the processes involved in the consulting business.  However, if you are looking for insights into McKinsey or ideas to improve your business, I am not confident that The McKinsey Way will be adequate.", "summary": "Good but Uninsightful", "unixReviewTime": 1150848000}

It could do with a decent editor. Grammatical mistakes abound and some of the content could do with it's own medicine - MECE.  Waffle and padding abound.\n\nIn summary: it's worth reading, but take note that the author only spent 3 years at McKinsey and, based on an average engagement length of 6 months, that means about 6 engagements (assuming one engagement at a time).

The book may be interesting for someone who would like to get a romanticized version of what it is like to be a respected consultant, but that's probably it- the book is more of a feel-good rahrah than anything truly unique and inspiring.

For example, he talks about running a project in specific phases, but does not explain elements such as workplanning, types of analysis or scope management in any depth. He basically mentions them as important. A key element that I believe is missing from the book is the concept of feedback and performance discussions. Consulting can offer the excellent learning exactly because it offers raw, data-driven and honest feedback. You will hear from your managers things you may not want, but may well need to hear. It is my belief McKinsey has more to offer than what mr Rasiel describes.\n\nFurthermore, the tone that mr Rasiel strikes may put some clients and even (potential) employees off. The feeling I got as I was reading the book was that senior clients are often considered difficult in their demands and client team members more often than not a pain to work with.

She betrays her father, her brother, and her entire heritage for the love of this handsome prince.  When he tosses her aside for her younger sister, Phaedre (who can bear sons where Ariadne can bear only daughters), Ariadne draw upon her power as Mistress of the Labyrinth and her brother's darkcraft to destroy the game, Theseus, and everything allied with him.  This is the basis of the entire series.\n\nA number of years later, we are introduced to the key characters, Brutus, Cornelia, and Genvissa.  Every one of these characters is significantly flawed in some way, and rather than add to the character, it makes them more tedious.  Brutus is greedy and abusive.  He takes his wife in 15 year old Cornelia and brutally rapes her on the night of their \"wedding\".  But it doesn't stop there.  The mental abuse and even beatings follow well into her labor, and up to and beyond the birth of thier child.  Cornelia is a spoiled and naive young child, but this is to be expected of an adolescent princess.  Her stubborness, rather than endearing her to the reader, makes her more annoying.  Finally, there is Genvissa, daughter-heir of the line of Ariadne.  Genevissa is manipulative and power hungry.  During the one point in the book where she speaks of love, it is completely unconvincing.\n\nThe story revolves around a love triangle created by the three characters.  Brutus is drawn to Cornelia, and insists she become his wife and go with him to create Troia Nova.  Genvissa is a witch who casts enchantments to convince Brutus, the homeless King of now broken Troy, to build Troia Nova on the far away shores of Langarlia.  Her goal, of course, is to lure Brutus to her side.  Cornelia, through this long journey, finds herself falling in love with her husband.  Brutus, on the other hand, tires of Cornelia and finds himself now drawn to the enigmatic and powerful Genvissa.\n\nThe basic plot of the book is that Genvissa plans to rebuild the Labyrinth with Brutus, a Kingman.  Deceptively simple, this book has many twists and turn that guarantee to keep the reader interested and offguard.\n\nDespite the tediousness of it's characters and the brutality (and even bestiality), the book tells a good story.  Douglass has a way of capturing the attention of her readers and getting them involved in a story, even if they despise what is being done in said story.

The characters, be they mortal or gods, are well known through the telling and re-telling of myths and legends through the millennia since the events were supposed to have happened. Somehow, Sara Douglass manages to strip the personality from the characters and excitement from the oft told tales, leaving the protagonists as cardboard cut outs meandering through a number of seemingly unrelated and uninspiring events.\nThe central character Cornelia is a spoiled brat, and several misfortunes befall her. However, it's hard to feel any sympathy for her because her own arrogance brings much of it on her own head. Her tormentor, and husband Brutus (now there's an original name), is the brooding, silent type, but is also a leader of people trying to rediscover their lost kingdom of Troy.\nOther characters come from ancient British mythology, and they are involved in incestuous relationships and fiddling with magic, but ultimately further confuse the messy story. As if this were not enough, Douglass also intersperses the story with flash-forwards to London during the Second World War, which shows the characters are still alive 3000 years after the original events.\nThrough it all there are episodes of graphic and gory violence, and unnecessarily brutal sex scenes. It is impossible to connect with any of the characters because they are so fatally flawed, and I actually found myself hoping something horrible would happen to some of them.

How about with the characters, not a single one of which is likable or admirable in any way. Each one is invariably one or more of the following: cruel, shallow, power-mad, spoiled, self-centered, whining, manipulative, duplicitous, and vindictive. Brutus, the male \"protagonist\", rapes his 15-year-old wife Cornelia on their wedding night, smacks her around repeatedly (including once while she is in labor with their son), and cheats on her with Genvissa, a blasphemous priestess who has sucked dry her own goddess in her lust for power. Lovely. We're supposed to feel OK about this, because Cornelia forgives him and moons around after him regardless. Oh yeah, she's an inspiring heroine for women everywhere.\nThen there's the plot, such as it is, a jumbled mish-mash of Greek and pre-Celtic mythological references used to support an utterly transparent and preposterous storyline that involves a disinherited patricidal Trojan (Brutus) and a spoiled and self-centered Greek princess (Cornelia) who travel to what will eventually become Britain to establish a new Troy. They're led there by Genvissa, an evil Llangarlian priestess (Llangarlia must be the silliest fantasy name I've yet to encounter) who wants access to the power Brutus wields over the Troy Game, an all-but-extinct form of labyrinth magic. Intrigued yet? Oh wait, there's more. Fathers rape daughters, sons kill mothers (and those are the *good* guys), and there is quite possibly the most disgusting and graphic miscarriage scene I have ever read. (No one who has ever given birth, or ever intends to, should read this scene. Do the words \"ruptured placenta\" mean anything to you?)\nI don't mind characters that are a mix of good and bad; Douglass' previous hero, Axis, did some pretty crappy things while he was saving the world and didn't feel too darn bad about it.  But there's a difference between a character who starts flawed and has to redeem themselves, or one who has to do some rotten things for the greater good, and a character who's just a jerk. I literally wanted to wash my hands when I set this book down. Don't waste the money.", "summary": "The worst book I've ever read", "unixReviewTime": 1073779200}

At the very least, you are supposed to have gained general problem solving skills. This book titled 'The McKinsey Way' is actually nothing but a systematic approach to managing the most common problems you will run into while working in Corporate America. These are the tested and proven success techniques that have worked for the consultants at McKinsey explained in very simplistic terms.\nIf you have a college degree, the chances are that you are already aware and exposed to a lot of these techniques. Nevertheless, it is definitely worthwhile spending a few dollars to own a copy of this book. The observations made in this book are those that are universal and don't necessarily change with time. So, the benefits of reading this book and applying these techniques can be very long lasting.\nThe author's writing style makes it very easy to read and understand the different topics presented in the book. The chapters can be read independently and so can the different sections in each chapter. Hence, you can read the book a few pages at a time and still benefit tremendously.\nYou can start applying these techniques right away so the benefits of reading this book can be seen immediately. It may be hard to believe that McKinsey is known to charge up to $800/hour for just doing these simple things but they do accomplish valuable results. And that's why corporations are willing to pay such a high price for McKinsey's consultants.\nHave fun reading this book and I hope you benefit from reading this book as much as I did! Did I mention that it has proved to be a great conversation piece?", "summary": "This is what you are supposed to learn in college.", "unixReviewTime": 1049414400}

Additionally, as a consultant who didn't travel or work very much at client sites, Rasiel couldn't give a complete picture of the consulting lifestyle.\nIn short, this is an interesting read if you are thinking of joining a management consulting firm; it does a decent job describing one person's experience.
