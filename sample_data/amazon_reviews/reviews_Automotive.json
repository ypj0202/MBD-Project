The grippers work really well in holding this stand steady so that your devices won't fall over because they are too heavy for this stand. I love this stand because it is hands free meaning I could pop a recipe up on my phone or tablet and be able to do everything it says without having to touch the device.

Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.\n\nPerhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.\n\nSorry, I cannot recommend.\n\nSample provided in exchange for an honest review.", "summary": "Works well if you place phone in horizontally (landscape mode).

For starters..this vacuum DOES fit in the bag. I attached a photo of mine showing how I place the items in the bag to get them to fit to help anyone out who may have problems with this bc I noticed on some reviews people say the stuff won't fit in the bag. The bag is small so you can't just throw everything in however you please or it won't fit. You gotta play Tetris with it and figure out how to fit it all just right. My picture shows the way I figured out how to place everything to get things to fit right and be able to zip the bag back up every time. So hopefully that will help future buyers. But this vacuum has worked great for maintaining cleanliness of my vehicle. Now my suv was destroyed inside . it was sooo dirty from months and months of dirt and dropped food pieces from the kids that we literally had to take a shop vac to it to get it cleaned or this little vacuum prob would have took forever to clean it. This little vacuum is not really made for super heavy duty jobs. Its more made to maintain keeping your vehicle clean after its already been heavy duty cleaned. But once I got the inside of my suv fully cleaned...I now use this once a week to go over the seats and carpets and dash area etc and it sucks up the dust and dirt in the carpets and seats etc just fine. My driver side floor gets pretty dirty after a week from dirt and it has no problems getting it clean. But like I said if your vehicle is very very dirty you may want to pull our your shop vac and save you some time and then just use this little guy once a week to keep it nice and clean.
