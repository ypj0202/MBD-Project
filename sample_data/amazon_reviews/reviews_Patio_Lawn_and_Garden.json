Mr. Spriggs is a very talented story teller.  Although set in the late 1950's, Johnson road could be found in the rural south still today.  The well developed characters propel the story along, distracting you as the real horrific crime occurs.  The author makes you realize that no one should look through the glass window of a neighbor's house and watch what really happens behind closed doors.  In fact, you'll wonder what is really happening in your own neighborhood after this read- Eeeeek!!!!  It's rare to find a mystery with this many twists and turns that is unsolvable yet believable.

I really enjoy a Murder Mystery that can keep me guessing, and Clayton E Spriggs has certainly achieved that me for me with this wonderful book. Hes done a great job with the characters, and taking us through their lives and background. Its very interesting that so much can go on in one little street. Detective Robert Stallworths instincts are correct when he instructs the troopers to start digging. He just has that gut feeling that theres a body buried right where hes standing. Its still a shock though when they do un-earth a human skull. Purvis liked being a hermit after the war. So he was pretty happy when he found a block of land on Johnson Road all by itself, where he could build a house and hide away. Before long he found he wanted company and Sue and her son moved in with him, and marriage followed soon after. It would have been better for their relationship if Purvis explained to Sue that he was tired all the time from his nightmares from the war, and getting very little sleep. Its pretty much what the whole town think of Purvis, that hes an old man and very slow in everything he does. Johnson Road was not going to stay the quiet out of the way street, when developers started building houses. So it wasn't long before families started to move in and fill the street. As with all families though, there were things going on behind closed doors that not everyone could see. Like Sue cheating on Purvis, which half the town seemed to know about. The Jenkins dog suddenly disappearing maybe not such a coincidence when you have a couple of bored delinquent boys living in the street. Its not such a stretch from bullying other kids to harming animals. Maybe if Frank and Jacks father wasn't such a mean drunk, they might have grown up differently. Thomas and Gladys had a hard time conceiving, and when Elizabeth finally came into the world they showered her with love and affection. Hence Elizabeth had a much better temperament than Frank and Jack. With a town Sheriff that liked to do as little as possible, it was relative easy for the towns locals to get away with all sorts of indiscretions. Detective Stallworth however is a completely different man, and not one to sit back like the sheriff. Although its a mystery even for him when little Elizabeth disappears completely off the face of the earth. Johnson Road is now going to become the centre of attention like never before, and could there be a murderer living on the street? I really enjoyed the ending, and Im certainly looking forward to continuing the series with book two  Peterson County Murders. This is definitely an Author that Ill be adding to my list to watch out for.", "summary": "Great Story", "unixReviewTime": 1479081600}

My major pet peeve was that one of this flag's sides was cut at a slant, rather than straight.  It's very irritating to look at, so i folded it over and taped it (this flag is on my wall.)  I feel like this kind of mistake is inexcusable, regardless of how much you pay.  It's not like it costs any money to measure it correctly, and it's abnormal shape affects what little functionality it has.  Considering what I paid, I expected the other cons of this flag and I am otherwise satisfied with it.  If it had been a reasonably perfect rectangle it would have been 4-5 stars.\n\nI recommend this for anyone who wants to use these flags for decoration somewhere free from the elements.  I have used flags with these flimsy materials outside before, and they don't last long, especially in the harsh New England weather.  Seriously, just buy the more expensive flag.
