I can tell you that if you love the Lord, this album should be part of your collection--if you can find it. I still have my original LP, the music book, and the songs in various Keith collections.\n\nThere isn't a dud on here, but the ones that shine the most for me include his rendition of the 23rd psalm (still my fav of all versions of this most beloved of psalms). A friend of mine from my previous church, the pianist/music teacher, used to play this when we got together for fellowship, her on piano and me singing, and it's still just the most beautiful adaptation in popular music of \"The Lord Is My Shepherd.\" Keith's vocals are full of emotion and true spiritual fervor and faith. Astonishing.\n\nAnother favorite is \"How Majestic Is Your Name\" (Psalm 8), a song I occasionally sing a capella when moved by the night sky or a sunset or some other wonder of nature. \"When I consider the heavens, the work of they fingers...\"  Keith's sense of wonder at God shines through this semi-meditative but passionate song.\n\nOn the darker, heavier side, you get a \"spiritual\" called \"Oh God, our Lord\" which is great to sing, but not an easy subject to digest with lyrics such as:\n\n\"Who you gonna throw in the lake of fire, O God our Lord?\n\nWho you gonna throw when the flames get higher, O God our Lord?\n\nThe Devil and the man with the dark desire, O God our Lord.\"\n\nKeith really gets into it, his voice low and heavy at times, high and full of pain at others.\n\nAnother deep, difficult song describes those times when we feel in need of assistance and we can only cry to God out of our frustration and helplessness:\n\n\"My flesh is tired of seeking God,\n\nBut on my knees I'll stay.\n\nI want to be a pleasing child,\n\nUntil that final day.\n\nMy mind is full of many thoughts\n\nThat clutter and confuse.\n\nBut standing firm, I will prevail,\n\nIn faith that I'll be used.\n\nAmen! I'm asking once again.\n\nWon't you help me my friend, Lord Jesus.\"\n\nKeith's voice is beautiful in those lines of pleading..\"won't you help me, my friend, Lord Jesus.\"\n\n\"There Is A Redeemer\" is a simple melody, simple earnest lyrics, and is so \"singable\" that it has earned a place in hymnals and worship services across the land. \"There is a Redeemer, Jesus, God's own son. Blessed Lamb of God...Messiah! Holy One. Thank you, oh, my Father, for giving us your Son and leaving Your Spirit till your work on Earth is done.\" It's a basic expression of gratitude and worship and it holds up.\n\n\"Jesus is Lord of All\" and \"You Are The One\" and \"The Promise Song\" are peppy and bouncy and full of joy and affirmation of truth. From the last of those we get this:\n\n\"Oh if you keep My word,\n\nI'll make you as a tree,\n\nPlanted by the streams of life,\n\nIf you'll submit to me.\n\nAnd if you love the hateful ones,\n\nWho mistreat you constantly,\n\nThe book of life shall bear your name,\n\nIf you love your enemies.\"\n\n \"Glory Lord Jesus\" is effervescent and energetic and will have you with your hands up in the air.\n\nLike his version of Psalm 23, Keith's version of \"Holy, Holy, Holy\" is part of the reason why that is among my most favorite of all classic hymns. I never tire of it.\n\nThose are most of the songs, and I think you will find pleasure and an encouragement to worship here. These are truly \"Songs for the Shepherd\" that all the sheep can treasure. Keith's earnest and passionate vocals, his skill on the piano, and the evident faith that colors all his songs shine decades after he got called home.\n\nMir of Mirathon blog", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2006", "summary": "Keith's Last and Best Album, A Classic and a Keeper!", "unixReviewTime": 1167350400}

But I cannot possibly recommend this album enough, not only do I like the idea of a physical copy of any music in and of itself, but the booklet included with this particular album helps flesh out the music more. In addition to containing lyrics to the songs, the booklet also has the story of the album. Yes, you heard that right, this album actually has a plot, this is a Christmas album, that tells a story. This is like some extraordinary and wonderful blend of Christmas album, Rock Opera, and Concept album: and I wouldn't have it any other  way.

The music demands to be heard. Even \"traditional\" songs are made new; just listen to O Come All Ye Faithful/O Holy Night to understand what I mean. A Mad Russian's Christmas brought a smile to my face.\n\nI think of the original songs, my favorites are A Star to Follow, The Silent Nutcracker (lovely acoustic guitar work!), Christmas Eve Sarajevo 12/24, Good King Joy, Old City Bar, and This Christmas Day. However, there isn't a bad track on this whole CD.\n\nI'm not all that fond of rock music, but the Trans-Siberian Orchestra's music is an exception. Try this CD and see if you like the group.
