Not overly mild, but very pleasant and not overpowering in my opinion.  I'd rank it as milder than the average Bath & Body Works lotion.  I'd love an even milder scent for my husband, but he doesn't hate it, and actually prefers it to the off-putting scent of things like unscented Lubriderm (which still has a strong odor).\n\nI'd had a tube of this about 15 or so years ago that lasted me for years and years, and thankfully this seems to be about the same product.  The formula is super thick and concentrated, and does not need to be applied quite as liberally as many other standard lotions.  Additionally, the formula doesn't cause as severe of pain when applied to skin that is literally splitting open from dryness.  This is a must have for people whose hands or other parts of the body start to bleed during the winter without constant attention.

Also, you need fast access to your cream, and twist tops just don't do the job. Lastly, when your fingers, fingernails, cuticles crack and peel, it can snag your fabric and threads, destroying your garment.\n\nI remembered this product and quickly bought the tube. THANK THE LORD I REMEMBERED THIS STUFF!!! Saved my life and fabric!\n\nThe pump is the best price--dollar per ounce--and the most convenient. The smell is great and the product is soaked up by my abused hands in seconds. Never have I ruined a good piece of silk, and rarely do my fingers snag fabric. The only time it does happen is when I forget to moisturize my hands.\n\nMy mom works in electronics and is the lead of production. She files papers all day and sometimes has to handle electronic components to help others. Her hands would crack and bleed from her work. It was painful to look at! Plus, she, too, cannot use greasy products, as that would ruin the electronics.\n\nAs she worked along with C&E Gardner's, her hands became normal once again, no longer embarrassing her.

It's one of the few that actually does what it says it will do. My issue with it is that Crabtree and Evelyn use palm oil in it, which I didn't realize until I read the product label the other day. And for those of you out there who don't know what the big deal is about, google palm oil plantations and the effects they have on local wildlife. It's horrifying to see what these plantations do to orangutans, tigers, etc-the farmers completely destroy the natural habitat so they can sell us cheap palm oil to use in our products. I'm boycotting Crabtree and Evelyn until they remove this from their products. I won't buy a product knowing that doing so is destroying the earth.", "summary": "Disappointed", "unixReviewTime": 1490572800}
