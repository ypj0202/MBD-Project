Cooper", "reviewText": "In this installment of Corduroy's adventures with Lisa, we see that some time has passed since she first brought him home from the department store.  She's taller, wearing her hair a little straighter, and her mom looks like she had a makeover, too.  Corduroy, however, is wearing the same green overalls he did in the first book and has managed to keep both buttons on this time.  Early on in the book, however, Corduroy decides he needs a pocket, and in the search for one gets separated from Lisa and her mom while they are in the laundromat.  They leave without him, setting him up for a meeting with a friendly stranger who washes his overalls for him, as well as encounters with such laundromat staples as powder detergent and pushcarts.\nAs in the first book, Lisa comes back for him the next day, and once again her needle and thread come to the rescue.\nThis book and \"Corduroy\" are the only two Corduroy books my daughter and I have read.  I wonder if there are others, and what kind of sartorial splendor Corduroy will be arrayed in next if the trend continued!", "summary": "More adventures with Lisa's very own bear. . .", "unixReviewTime": 980294400}

With better parent-child bonding from reading,  you child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to  others.  Intellectual performance will expand as well.  Spending time  together watching television fails as a substitute.\nTo help other  parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our  youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were  read to her as a young child.  A Pocket for Corduroy was one of her picks.  Since the story is well summarized here at Amazon.com, I would like to  focus on why the story is an important one to share.\nFirst, Lisa is shown  as being not such a young child.  Yet she carries her teddy bear, Corduroy,  with her openly.  No one comments on that, shames her about it, or acts as  though she is doing anything strange.  Children draw great comfort from  familiar objects, teddy bears, blankets, and other stuffed toys.  This book  endorses that connection, overcoming the stalled thinking that children  must quickly become little adults.\nSecond, Lisa helps her Mother do the  laundry as her primary focus.  That shows a connectedness to her Mother and  the family that is very encouraging for a child.  She can make a  contribution although she is a child.\nThird, Lisa makes every attempt to  be responsible about Corduroy.  She tells Corduroy to wait in a chair and  not to move.  She tries to find Corduroy before leaving the laundromat, and  gets her Mother to agree to come back again the next day to find him.  Although she is sad, she overcomes her reluctance to be separated and  leaves.  This suggests that she can and should trust that everything will  turn out all right.  This reinforces an optimism that is good for children  to develop.\nFourth, all of the adults act in responsible ways.  Lisa's  Mother brings her back.  The artist who finds Corduroy in his laundry bag  dries his clothes for him and leaves him where he can easily be found the  next day.  The man who works in the laundry helps Lisa and her Mother find  Corduroy the next day.  This encourages the idea that everyone can and will  help one another.  This is a good role model for children as they imagine  what they should be like as adults.\nFifth, the whole misadventure  relates to Corduroy feeling bereft because he does not have a pocket.  So  Lisa sews one for him, caring for him in a nurturing way even though he is  only a teddy bear.  Caring about others is a great way to feel better about  oneself.\nAs you can see, the book is filled with optimistic, caring,  considerate human values expressed through the story.  You can reinforce  this by discussing with your child how s/he might care for a favorite  stuffed animal or blanket during an upcoming trip.  This can help reduce  the anxiety caused by concerns about the changes, and assist your child in  being careful so the loved connection is not lost.\nYou and your child  will feel affirmed and closer after you read and review this story  together.\nOvercome your stalled thinking about providing affirmations  to your child with this book!", "summary": "Read to Your Child to Create Bonding and Intellect", "unixReviewTime": 964915200}

As Lisas mom reminds her to empty her pockets, Corduroy decides he needs a pocket on his overalls and sets out on a search to find one.  What might he find along the way?  Will he wander completely away from Lisa?\n\nThis is a sweet and fun book that I think I might like better than the original.  The reason for this is the creativity of what Corduroy runs across in the laundromat and what he thinks it might be.  We, of course, know better, but his guesses make perfect sense from his experiences.  The pictures are wonderful and expertly capture the story.\n\nIf you are a fan of this stuffed bears first adventure, don't hesitate to get this one.

No disrespect to others' opinions; it just seems to me that everyone is too sensitive to everything today. Anyway, as you probably know by now, Cord gets left behind at the Laundromat, has a small nighttime adventure involving a dryer ride, a soap waterfall, and being rediscovered by Lisa.

And if Courduroy is too precious to get lost, shouldn't it be LISA'S name on the little card in his pocket?  It's all very sloppy and undermines any residual charm left over from the first book.

Very soon after introducing the book, our daughter began having terrible anxiety about being dropped off at a children's group that she'd always loved before. Suddenly it occurred to me that it was probably the book. Lisa takes Corduroy with her to a laundromat and Corduroy wanders away into a stranger's laundry bag. Lisa and her mother have to leave without Corduroy, and the stranger throws Corduroy into a dryer. He doesn't start the machine but pulls Corduroy out and undresses him to dry the bear's overalls. Corduroy waits with this stranger, undressed, while his overalls dry. Then the stranger puts Corduroy's clothes back on and puts him up on a shelf. The attendant turns out all the lights and Corduroy is left all alone in the dark, abandoned by his loved ones, locked in a strange place. He gets into some mischief and seems to enjoy himself, but as another reviewer mentioned, the drawings reflect the darkness of a closed laundromat and it looks pretty scary.

He wanders off, ends up in a bag of wet laundry, goes for a spin in the dryer, tips a box of soap, and ends up trapped in a rolling laundry basket. Lisa finds him first thing the next day, and lovingly scolds him, saying she would be happy to make him a pocket.\n\nThe story has a bit of the obligatory alliteration that is often Don Freeman's trademark, but it feels a bit empty. It just doesn't have quite the sweetness and cleverness that so many of Don Freeman's stories have that make for an enduring book (ie. one you or your child will want to pull of the shelf time and time again).\n\nI'm not disappointed we added this to our collection.

In this superb little book, David Bornstein and Susan Davis straightforwardly put this question to rest: \"Social entrepreneurship is a process by which citizens build or transform institutions to advance solutions to social problems, such as poverty, illness, illiteracy, environmental destruction, human rights abuses, and corruption, in order to make life better for many.\" So much for all those deconstructionists who contend that a social enterprise must never turn a profit, or must always turn a profit, or must address some sorts of problems but not others!\n\nAs an introduction to the field, Social Entrepreneurship is unmatched.\n\nMost books on social entrepreneurship feature case studies or vignettes starring some of the field's most innovative and successful individuals. This was the case with an earlier book of Bornstein's, How to Change the World, which is widely (and rightfully) regarded as \"the bible\" of the field. By contrast, the three short chapters that constitute Social Entrepreneurship ask and answer the most fundamental questions that any reader unfamiliar with the pursuit of social change might ask, first clarifying the definition of social entrepreneurship, then examining the practical challenges practitioners face, and finally \"Envisioning an Innovating Society.\" In that third chapter, Bornstein and Davis discuss how government, academia, business, philanthropy, and the news media might contribute to fashioning the \"everyone a changemaker\" world posited by Ashoka's Bill Drayton.\n\nAs the authors point out, \"Social entrepreneurs have always existed. But in the past they were called visionaries, humanitarians, philanthropists, reformers, saints, or simply great leaders. Attention was paid to their courage, compassion, and vision but rarely to the practical aspects of their accomplishments. Thus, people may know about the moral teachings of St. Francis but not about how the Franciscans became the fastest growing religious order of its day. Children learn that Florence Nightingale ministered to wounded soldiers but not that she built the first professional school for nurses and revolutionized hospital construction. Gandhi is remembered for demonstrations of nonviolent rsistance but not for building a decentralized political apparatus that enabled India to make a successful transition to self-rule.\" And if St. Francis, Florence Nightingale, and Gandhi exemplified the isolated and occasional social entrepreneurs of yesteryear, there are thousands of courageous individuals now walking parallel paths to institutional change on every continent -- backed up by a growing suport network that includes Ashoka, the Skoll Foundation, the Schwab Center for Social Entrepreneurship, Avina, and many other organizations. Given the enormity of the challenges facing humanity in the 21st Century, their combined efforts may represent our last, best hope to create a world in which our grandchildren can live healthy, rewarding lives.\n\nDavid Bornstein and Susan Davis came to the task of writing this book with impeccable qualifications. In addition to How to Change the World, which went into a second edition in 2007, Bornstein wrote The Price of a Dream: The Story of the Grameen Bank, first published in 1996. He is the preeminent journalist in the field. Davis is a supremely accomplished activist, having served as a founding member of the Grameen Foundation and then co-founding BRAC USA, which she serves as President and CEO. (BRAC began its institutional life as a Bangladeshi nonprofit, later expanding to many other countries around the world. It is regarded as the world's largest NGO.) She also helps select Ashoka Fellows. Previously, she held a series of senior positions with the Ford Foundation, Women's World Banking, the International Labor Organisation, and other institutions.\n\n[...]", "summary": "Social entrepreneurship: what it is, how it works, where it's going", "unixReviewTime": 1340582400}
