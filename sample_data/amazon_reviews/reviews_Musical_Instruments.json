Everything is explained in great detail from choosing yarns and hooks, to how to work a large array of crochet stitches, to how to read a pattern, right down to how to care for ones crocheted items.\n\nThe stitch drawings are clear and expertly done making learning new stitches so much easier.\n\nThe book has both a contents page and an index for easy referral.  I especially liked the fact that an index was included.  So many crochet books do not include this.  The index makes it very easy to find information on a particular topic quickly.\n\nThe recommendations for people just learning to crochet are fantastic.  This book wasn't out when I learned to crochet and I learned the hard way about many of the pit falls this book helps one to avoid.  For instance they recommend one start out with a size H-8 crochet hook and a light colored worsted weight yarn.  I learned with a B-1 hook and a fingering weight yarn.  After 2 whole days of crocheting it was 36\" long and 1.5\" tall.  I was trying to make a baby blanket for my doll (which never got made).\n\nThe book contains humor, not just in the cartoons but in the instructions as well which makes for very entertaining reading while one learns a new craft.  I always appreciate having a teacher with a sense of humor!\n\nA good sampling of designs is included so that one can try out their skills.  These include sweaters, an afghan, doilies, hot pads, pillow, scarves, floral motifs, and bandanas.\n\nI am a crochet designer and I read the book cover to cover like a storybook while on vacation this past week.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a few things as well.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the art of crochet.", "summary": "Terrific Book for Learning the Art of Crochet", "unixReviewTime": 1092009600}

No instructions for that are in this book - and it is a staple for anyone making an amigurumi project, among other things.  Next I looked up, \"camel stitch\" and it wasn't there either.  I easily found a youtube video for it, but shouldn't it be in Crocheting For Dummies???  Feeling too stupid for this book.  Either that or some pretty important things have been left out.

I had a few people recommend this book to me, so I gave it a shot.  The book goes over basic stitches with instructions and pictures.  I read the Part 1 without completing any of the practice stitches. Then moved on to Chapter 6 and began the Sassy Scarf Project.  The chapter details out each stitch in the project and you get plenty of practice with each stitch (240 stitches to be exact) before moving on to the next stitch.  By completing the project while learning the stitches, it is very gratifying to have something to show for all of your hard work rather than a small patch of material that amounts to nothing.  I didn't worry too much about being perfect the first time.  If you get stuck on something, just move on and later it may become more clear to you.\nAfter completing the scarf project, I moved on to the Bucket Hat project.  Then I found some patterns online.  I was truly a novice in the craft of crochet, and this book has helped me to complete several crocheting projects.

First, I don't recommend the Kindle version, and second, I don't believe it's a good book for complete beginners (at least the Kindle version isn't).\n\nI knew how to crochet many years ago, had been away from it, and decided to take it up again.  So I already had the very basics down and just wanted a refresher on some things that I had forgotten (or never really learned correctly the first time).  I think this book would have provided that information very well.\n\nHowever, there were several major problems.\n\nFirst, the instructional diagrams were so tiny that I could barely see them.  I would guess this isn't the case in the paperback version.  This is why I don't recommend it for beginners - because you really can't see the diagrams well enough for them to help, and I think those diagrams are necessary for an absolute beginner.\n\nSecond, there are a number of projects in the book, but there were no pictures of the finished projects.  I have no way to decide if I want to make it or not if I can't see the finished item. Apparently in the paperback version there is a \"color section\" with photos of the projects, but this was nowhere to be found in my Kindle version - which is ridiculous considering how extremely well the Kindle Fire would be at displaying those pictures.\n\nI chose to return this book.  I rarely, rarely return Kindle books, and I debated about it for several days.  I ultimately made that decision for one main reason.  I think it's shameful when publishers cut corners with Kindle editions of books, especially when the Kindle edition costs *almost as much* as the paperback edition.  It's like we're being punished for choosing to read books on a Kindle:  \"You're going to pay almost as much but you don't get the same content as everyone else.\"  And, again, especially when there's no reason for it - the Kindle Fire is extremely well suited to pictures and photographs.\n\nI'd still like a good crochet reference, and I may consider picking up this book in it's paperback form, because I still think it has good information in it.  I just want to go somewhere where I can look at it in person before I decide to do that.\n\nBut I can't recommend the Kindle version, based on my experience.\n\nEdited Dec. 2013 - they must have drastically dropped the price on this book, because I just noticed it's now $5.99 but I know I paid way more than that for it - I believe $10-something.  Just wanted to clarify, since my review said it cost \"almost as much as the paperback edition\" - it did, when I bought it.

Crochet is one of my hobbies that I revisit from time to time and this book caught my eye. Like all the books in the dummies series, the layout and format were true to form. The book contains information for the beginner and the advanced and everything in between.\n\nThere is all the basics about basic stitches and hooks and advanced techniques like crocheting with beads, weaving, and crocheting with wire. For me the hardest part of crochet is interpreting the pattern. Not to worry, there is a table of all the common abbreviations and many helpful tips on how to read a pattern. There are several patterns in the book. There are also conversion charts for the American, Continental, and British sizing of hooks.\n\nThe book has a healthy dose of humor, for example, there is a chart of \"10 handy household uses for crochet hooks\". Among the suggestions listed are, Stake up a plant, and Spear the last olive at the bottom of the jar.\n\nThe book talks about, among other things, blocking sweaters, the afghan stitch, crocheting in circles, selecting the right yarn, all the basic stitches and a number of the advanced ones, getting the tension right and joining seams. This is a great reference book, as well as being interesting reading for a crocheter.

This way you can test yourself and then easily check to make sure you were reading it accurately.\n\nI invested in some cheap, small sticky notes and can flip with ease to any stitch I want in the book as a refresher.\n\nI highly recommend this book to take your crocheting to the next level! :)", "summary": "Super Helpful!", "unixReviewTime": 1357603200}

As much as any two dimensional pictures can teach crochet, this book is wonderful.  Of course, I'm sure it is good for right handers, too!
