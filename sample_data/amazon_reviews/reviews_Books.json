It is a book full of some of the most beautiful and captivating poetry in the English language.\n\nI grew up with this book, and learned to love literature and poetry, and the magical world between the covers of a book. Oh! What flights of imagination I went on, reading this lovely book.\n\nWhen I got married, my husband quoted \"Lochinvar\" from memory, substituting his own name for the last word in the Lochinvar poem! I was so surprised, and everyone cracked up laughing. The reason I knew this poem by Sir Walter Scott was because of this book.\n\n\"Tiger, Tiger, burning bright, in the forests of the night ...\" - \"The Highwayman came riding, riding, riding ...\" The Fish - \"... And I let the fish go.\" Kentucky Belle. The Battle of Bunker Hill. Wynken, Blynken and Nod. Short, funny poems by Ogden Nash. The Blind Men and the Elephant. Abou Ben Adhem - may his tribe increase! So many wonderful poems are in this book.\n\nMy old book had fallen apart. I work at a school where bookbinding classes were taught. I brought my book in, and got it fixed.\n\nNow, just last week, although I never got to have children myself, life has given me the amazing gift of two little great granddaughters, ages five and eight. What better gift for them than this book, where they will be able to be enchanted by poetry as I was, to grow with it, and they can read the poem that great-grandpa recited by heart after he got married for the second time, way back before they were born.\n\nI am so grateful to see this book on Amazon.

That is because while the book is written by Dr. Seuss it features the jolly drawings of the English artist Quentin Blake.  Until this point every time I have read a book written by Dr. Seuss it was also illustrated by Dr. Seuss and when somebody else did the drawings Dr. Seuss used the name Theo. LeSieg (which is \"Geisel\" backwards).  So the fact that this is a real \"Dr. Seuss\" book drawn by somebody else is pretty special.\nThis Bright and Early Book provides rhymed text and illustrations introducing the many meanings of the word \"up\" as Seuss and Blake show beginning readers that this is a \"Great day for up!\"  You get the point half way through the book but little kids should be able to hand on longer, especially when they are reading the book for themselves.  Besides, by the end of \"Great Day for Up\" we get to the point where \"EVERYONE on Earth is up!\" (with one very important and rather ironic exception).\nAs with all of the Bright and Early Books for Beginning Beginners what you have here is a brief and funny story, where the words are few and easy, there is a catchy rhythm, and the pictures are happy and colorful clues to the text.  These are designed for an even lower age group than the Bright and Early Books that followed \"The Cat in the Hat,\" which was the \"Harry Potter\" of its day when it came to encouraging even pre-schoolers to discover the delights of reading for themselves.  This is not one of the most interesting volumes in the series, but overall these books were a delight.", "summary": "Dr. Seuss let's somebody else draw his book on \"Up\"", "unixReviewTime": 1087776000}

Dr. Seuss has written a book here to can allow you to help your child understand that problem by looking at what \"up\" can mean in different contexts.  The beautiful watercolor and inked outline illustrations by Quentin Blake provide great context for these meanings.\n\"Up! Up!  The sun is getting up.\nThe sun gets up\nso UP with you!\"\nThus, this book begins.  You can see that Dr. Seuss has already connected the idea of the sun rising above the horizon in the east with your rising from your bed.  The book goes on to explore all the things that can rise.  These includes ears on a rabbit, hands, whiskers, and eyes.\nOnce he goes into eyes, he then points out that many living creatures have eyes (including worms, frogs, butterflies, whales, and insects).\nThen, Dr. Seuss returns to \"up\" and gives new meanings.  These include taking something from a lower position to a higher one (like putting your feet up by walking on your hands), throwing things into the air (like balls), guiding things into the air (like kites), climbing (like going up a mountain -- Mt. Dill-ma-dilts in this case), and building mechanisms that can go up (like an elevator or a ferris wheel).\nThen, he returns ingeniously to the original concept of arising from bed:\n\"Wake ever person,\npig and pup,\ntill EVERYONE\non Earth is up!\"\nThen comes the surprise ending that will keep you and your child chuckling for years.\nAt first, you may just think the ending is there simply for humor, but it actually extends your child's understanding of what saying \"up\" means in terms of cause and effect.\nThe book has all of the qualities I look for in an early reader.  The language is simple.  There is a limited vocabulary of short words.  The illustrations tie in clearly to the words.  The story is interesting, humorous, and upbeat.  A child can learn to recognize the key word, up, in just a few readings.\nAfter your child has mastered this wonderful story, I suggest that you encourage your child to use this book to identify synonyms for \"up\" which will extend the value of the book.  For example, you can use \"arise\" or \"rise\" in many of the contexts.  Then you can discuss how a speaker or a writer chooses which word version of a concept to use.\nMay all of your child's learning experiences be UP to the ones available in this book!", "summary": "Explores the Many Meanings of the Word, Up", "unixReviewTime": 982972800}

The next most important industry after oil in the Middle East is carpets. The author, Kremmer, is a journalist who spent a decade travelling around the region, reporting on various events for Australian new agencies of one sort or another. This is his story of his love affair with carpets, which turns into a pretty serious study of their styles, manufacture, sale and trade, and of the significance of these items in Muslim culture. While the oil is irrelevant to Muslims, except in terms of the money it generates, carpets can tell a lot about the heritage of the Muslim world.\n\nFor the most part, this is interesting, and there's a lot to learn about Muslims and carpets. Only towards the end of the book does the author begin to veer into actual politics, and then, of course, he turns out to think that American policy in the Middle East is too agressive (this was late in the Clinton years...one shudders to think what his opinions are now). Thankfully, he at least hates Saddam Hussein and the mullahs who run Iran (journalists typically don't like governments that restrict freedom of the press, regardless of whatever else they do).\n\nThis one proviso aside, there's a lot of intersting material here, and the book is well-written, the characters drawn interestingly, and the settings well-rendered.

Since most of it was written, and concerns events, before 9/11, when the area was not established in the West's cultural radar as it is today, it gives a view of the region that is uncluttered by hindsight reevaluations.\nKremmer writes of his time in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikstan, Kashmir, and Iran, giving us colorful and non-journalistic slices of life from each region.  He enlivens his writings with vivid character studies of those he met on his travels, from dignitaries like ill-fated Afghan dictator Mohammed Najibullah and legendary guerilla Ahmad Shah Massoud to various carpet dealers Kremmer got to know over his time in the region.  Between these character sketches and Kremmer's anecdotes, he delivers measured doses of regional history and politics, and he imparts a surprising amount of information about his favorite hobby, the Asian carpet.\nThe result is more than just some very entertaining travel writing.  Kremmer's lively and discursive work also functions as an excellent introduction to the Central Asian economy and politics.  Besides being for those who just like to read about travel in interesting foreign parts, The Carpet Wars will also be useful for non-scholars who want to have some idea how movements like the Taliban came to be, but want to take a spoonful of sugar with this medicine.\n(Kremmer's book also taught me that I'll never know enough to bargain effectively for an Asian carpet -- but his rueful and wry work also admits that there is a certain pleasure in being cheated.)", "summary": "Painless Education", "unixReviewTime": 1089244800}

Both extremes can get tiring pretty quickly.\nThe Carpet Wars was exactly in the middle, and it was fascinating. It was extremely informative about the history, politics, religion and, yes, even the carpets of the region from Pakistan to Iran.  Carpets were merely the thread (so to speak) that held the several first-hand accounts of travels to the region.\nKremmer is a master story teller, and very funny.  Sometimes it was hard to tell what was more enjoyable, the story he was telling or the way he was telling it.\nHis accounts of places with which he is very familiar are told in the rich tones of a deep affection.

For centuries, carpets have been a currency and an export, among the first commodities of a globalized trading system\" writes the author, who has spent ten years in Asia reporting for the Australian press.  He uses Oriental rugs as his motif for writing about his travels in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Tajikistan, Kashmir, and the former Soviet satellite countries of Central Asia.  {Here, this reviewer admits his interest enfolds some bias because of my own travels through the region as a Peace Corps worker in less turbulent times.  Also, I have the good fortune of working in a store where a wide variety of the very finest examples of Oriental carpets are sold.}\n In this book we read that second only to oil, hand made carpets are the region's principal export and were so long before Marco Polo made his famous travels along the Silk Road.  Carpets created by various quarreling factions from the Middle and Near East are the focus for retelling how the fighting clans have damaged the carpet trade, effectively wiping out the middle and upper class of society, and left appalling poverty and misery in its wake.  Kremmer describes how that even in the midst of war and turmoil, a bazaar will spring up during breaks in the fighting and the carpet merchants will quickly resume business as if nothing had happened.  A disappointment for me was that the author omits a description of the many varieties and techniques of rug making; he remains focused on his travels through the Islamic world, giving us the benefit of his first hand witness to the misery.\n Believing that only Allah can create anything perfect, the Muslim carpet makers often will deliberately craft a minor flaw in their handiwork that only a practiced eye might discern.  Also, we learn that many rugs woven by people living under the duress of conflict will reflect their anxieties and turmoil through the symbols of war - airplanes, helicopters, tanks, and guns.  But the rugs also will contain symbols of their makers' traumatic lives not altogether discernible or understood.  Like the great paintings of the Renaissance, these works of art may never be fully comprehended.  It is enough that fortunate owners of hand knotted and woven rugs might appreciate not only their beauty but also how they portray the soulful deeper meaning of the lives of their creators, leaving a legacy for generations to come.

The early books were traditional police procedurals set in the unique environment and society of the Navajo Reservation.  The crimes that led to murder were relatively small in magnitude: stealing Indian artifacts, robbing a casino, or revenge.  In recent Hillerman books, the crimes have grown in scope to encompass serial killing, international drug smuggling, and theft of billions of dollars worth of natural gas.  Bigger is not necessarily better.  The Sinister Pig seems closer to Ludlum that to early Hillerman.\nA CIA expert on middle eastern oil pipeline technology is murdered while on a freelance investigation for a US Senator in the Four Corners area.  Both Chee and the local FBI agent are quickly frozen out of the investigation by FBI headquarters.  Chee continues to probe for information with help from the retired Leaphorn, \"Cowboy\" Dashee (now a BLM law enforcement officer), and Bernie Manuelito who has joined the US Customs Border Patrol.\nAs in Wailing Wind, Bernie is the pivotal character in the story.  Through her eyes Hillerman shows the reader how the US Government goes about trying to interdict illegal immigration and drug trafficking on the border with Mexico.  It is not pretty.  Chee is as inept as ever in dealing with his romantic interest in Bernie.  While there were genuine obstacles to overcome in Chee's earlier love affairs, his inability to make his true feelings known to Ms Manuelito seems merely callow.\nWe know who the villain of the piece is almost from the outset.  He not only has the CIA agent killed, but arranges to have a young congrssional aide he has impregnated vanish.  Lacking the whodunit element, the reader has only suspense to fuel his interest.\nHillerman's descriptive skill is as sharp as ever and his ear for dialogue as true.  Leaphorn is still Leaphorn.

This time the plot is in part inspired by the continuing scandal over the mismanagement - embezzlement and outright theft may be closer to the point - of funds due to Southwest Indian tribes for oil, gas, and coal taken from their reservations under Federal auspices.  An investigator sent by a powerful Washington, DC, senator to nose around turns up dead with a bullet in his back.  It is Jim Chee's case - or at least as much of the case as the FBI will let him handle - but it is immediately clear that somebody with high connections back in Washington wants the investigation squelched.\nMeanwhile, Jim Chee has something else on his mind.  Bernadette Manuelito, formerly an officer in the Navajo Tribal Police, has taken a new job with the Border Patrol, 200 miles away, just when Chee was working up his resolve to make his personal interest clear to her.  And now Bernie has stumbled on some mysterious goings-on along the Mexican border that might tie in to the unsolved murder back home.\nHillerman departs somewhat from his usual format by writing several chapters from outside the viewpoint of Leaphorn and Chee (and Bernie Manuelito).  Unlike in most Hillerman novels, we very quickly learn who the bad guys are, although a mystery remains until the final chapters as to exactly what they are doing.  In general Hillerman's villains are not especially villainous, their motivations often arising from quite ordinary circumstances that lead them into crimes they never intended.  But in \"The Sinister Pig\" the chief villain is as close to plain evil as Hillerman is ever likely to get.\nOne disappointment: an element which usually sets Hillerman's mystery novels apart from all others is their exploration of the culture and religion of the Navajos and their Indian neighbors, this being integral to the book plot and often crucial to the solution of the mystery at hand.  In the present novel we see almost nothing of this, except for some peripheral matters that only touch upon Jim Chee himself.  Washington powerbrokers are a less engaging group than the people of the Big Rez.\n\"The Sinister Pig\" is not the best of Hillerman, to be sure, and it might be argued that it works primarily as simply being part of a continuing series about characters to whom we have come to feel close over the years.  But a Hillerman book that is not amongst his best work is still a good mystery.  And readers who count Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee as literary friends will want to find what has now happened in their personal lives.\nHillerman's Navajo novels have continuing background stories that develop from novel to novel over time.  Therefore, readers new to Hillerman would be well advised to begin not with this latest novel but back at the beginning of the series, getting to know the characters as their lives evolve.  There's plenty of good reading to be had along the way.", "summary": "Good, but not the best Hillerman", "unixReviewTime": 1052265600}

Mostly I think it's because I've only recently developed an affection for the mystery/thriller genre.\n\nAlthough sixteenth in a series, I don't get the impression that reading the previous fifteen books in a necessity to enjoy this.

She quickly develops a reputation for herself and while helping out some stranded border-crossers, she is told that a photo of her has been circulating around Mexico, identifying her as potentially dangerous and someone the criminals might want to be rid of. She becomes a target when she visits an exotic game ranch which was once a station for a gas pipeline.  Unknown to Bernie, but figuring it out when he learns she's become a target, is Sergeant Jim Chee, who is madly in love with Bernie.  The old pipe lines might be in use to smuggle something in to the country. But knowing what is being smuggled and who is the force (and money) behind the operation, is something that brings even more danger to Bernie, Chee, and Joe Leaphorn.\n\nI found this to be pretty standard (and average) mystery/thriller fare.

I'm not real fond of the deus ex machina  ending or the dumb luck/getting out of a jam because of something or someone completely outside of the protagonists control.\n\nAs I say, this was pretty average.
