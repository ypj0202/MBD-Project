The place I work, took out it's fryer probably over 10 to 15 years ago and have never looked back.  Cut his insurance significantly and they did not use it enough for it not to be a hassle when it was used.  However, no matter what anyone says, some things just need to be deep fried, there is not good substitute for example, mozzarella sticks. We have tried doing them with a kettle on the stove, home frier and purchased products that we were guaranteed could be done in the oven.  We have made our own and pre fried them then finished them in the oven and we have made ones that we did in the oven from beginning to the end.  There is just no substitute.  We had a wedding to serve that was very upscale but mozzarella sticks are the grooms favorite so we needed to do something.  I did not want to spend a lot of money on a tool that would not get that much use but from past experiences knew any of the fryers you get that use a gallon or less of oil are useless for mass production.  I decided on this one after reading the reviews.\n\nUnboxing and set up are easy.  Be careful, this is not high grade stainless steel not matter the specs listed.  The insert that hold the grease is like a a medium quality hotel pan. It got up to temp quickly and maintained heat well.  The fryer basket holds a 2# bag of moz sticks perfectly and they fried beautifully.  Clean up is easy and it fits nicely on our ss work table.\n\nI do not think this unit will take abuse or a lot of hard use well but if you treat it respectfully and with the knowledge that it is not an industrial fryer, there is no reason it should not work for some time and work well.", "summary": "Not bad at all for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1480636800}

The thermostat finally failed on it so we ordered this replacement. It came in damaged but we were able to straighten it out. It was packed well but the box took a big hit on one corner during shipping. The label on the unit and the information on the product page state that the wattage is 2500 but as with our old unit we checked the current draw and it reads 13 amps. That comes out to about 1500 watts. It works well. takes about 10 to 15 minutes to heat to 350F. The old unit had a oil level mark but this one does not. We transferred the oil to the new one and marked it with a scratch on the pan. We measured the oil volume and it came out to 5 liters. I think that if you filled it with 6 liters it would boil over too easy. We use this in a outdoor kitchen so we don't worry too much about fire hazard but this unit has no UL or other safety testing and has no over temp safety controls so don't leave it unattended for very long. Large capacity lets you cook a batch of whatever you like without the oil heat loss you get with smaller units. Good crispy non greasy fish and fries are great.", "summary": "Good unit but the wattage not 2500", "unixReviewTime": 1477440000}
