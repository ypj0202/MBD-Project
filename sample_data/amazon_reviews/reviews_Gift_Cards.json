My Sister-in-law, the recipient of one of those $50 Amazon Gift Cards called me to say that she's lost the Gift Card (most likely accidentally discarded with all of the Christmas paper, etc. and burned in the trash). I told her \"no problem\", since I had kept my receipt from Bi Lo that includes the Amazon Gift Card Number, and I felt certain that Amazon would be able to see that no purchases had been made against their Gift Card Number and that either Amazon or Bi Lo would be able to cancel that card and issue a new one, or Credit her online Amazon Account $50 and bypass issuing a new physical card altogether. I was sadly mistaken.... when she initially contacted Amazon, they told her that since the Amazon Card was purchased from Bi Lo, we would need to take the matter up with them. I went to Bi Lo and was told that there wasn't anything that they could do and that I would need to contact Amazon. Since my Sister-in-law had already contacted Amazon and been turned away, I decided since I was the one who made the purchase and had the receipt, I would call my Credit Card Company first to see if they might be able to offer some assistance in getting the matter resolved since I had purchased all of the Gift Cards with my Credit Card. After 30 minutes discussing the details with my Credit Card Company, they said they understood my dilemma but weren't able to dispute the charge with Bi Lo. They suggested I contact Amazon directly since I had my receipt with Amazon's Gift Card number on and since it was Amazon's gift card. So... after about 30 minutes on the phone with a very nice gentleman from Amazon who made 2 attempts to get his Supervisor to approve some type of credit for the loss, he sadly informed me that Amazon isn't responsible for purchases of their Gift Cards that aren't made from their website. I told him that since Amazon isn't willing to offer any assistance, even though they can clearly see in their system a $50 unused Credit on that lost Gift Card and since I had my receipt with their Gift Card number printed on the receipt (proof that I had purchased their Gift Card), I felt as though Amazon had ROBBED me of $50, since the only one who will benefit financially from this gift transaction is Amazon and I had certainly not intended to add \"Amazon\" as one of my 2015 Christmas names to buy for! Furthermore, I told him that I would not be making any more purchases from Amazon directly or purchasing any other Amazon Gift Cards in the future and would encourage others to do the same.

My husband was issued a $50 gift card from his work over a year ago and had been waiting to use it on something he or I needed.

Because my husband and I each have our own Amazon accounts, created before we were married, and maintained for buying the surprise birthday, Christmas, or anniversary gift. And here is where the CATCH comes in... Any purchases or that were made on an Amazon gift card, or if a gift card was even just registered under a particular individual/account can not be used or shared by someone else. The powers that be at Amazon consider that transferring. This includes any minor children that may have an account not just your spouse. Which means...I would have to spend personal money out of pocket if I wanted to still buy these items off Amazon, instead of using a perfectly good gift card that would have covered the balance. Or the other option which was never suggested was log into my husbands account not look at what he bought me in his previous purchase section and buy what I wanted for my nephew and kids on my husbands account only after I ask him for his password (which he would have given me.)\n\nDon't bother taking into account that minors can not own items so to restrict the transfer of property (from parent to child) is illegal and minors can not be bound to such agreements ...and I myself live in a joint property state so at the end of the day what is my husbands is mine and mine is his.", "summary": "Company Gift Card Fraud", "unixReviewTime": 1449014400}
