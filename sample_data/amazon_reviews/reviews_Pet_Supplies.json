The photos in this chapter are invaluable and beautiful.\n\nCons --\n\n-- The \"conversational style\" is something a reader may like, or may not. I did not.  I want a clear explanation of a topic, not a conversation with someone who is trying to be casual, witty and amusing for reasons that don't help the explanation along.  The author is apparently trying, in part, to make the book entertaining enough so that the reader wants to learn about the subject; virtually anyone who buys this book, though, already has enough interest in the subject to sustain them through the reading of the book.\n\n-- The text on pages 130 and 131 is juxtaposed one with the other.\n\n-- The chapter that many readers would want to be the most complete and cutting-edge (that on care of clams in the aquarium, Chapter 5) is the least informational of the book.  The worst section in that chapter is probably the section on lighting.  This section includes absolutely no mention of lighting intensity in any usably objective terms (PAR or even lux), and wastes five paragraphs with a repetitive monologue of his subjective opinions on the 'looks' of various color temperature bulbs.  This chapter also includes a section on feeding, which spends ALL of its ten pages explaining how, how much, what and when to feed, only to conclude with the recommendation \"if you want to avoid all of this, just do what I've done for years (as have a gazillion other hobbyists) and only keep tridacnids in well-established, well-stocked aquariums with bright lights and don't worry about them.(p. 183)\"  It should also be pointed out that the book devotes most of Chapter 2 to why Tridacnids need not be fed at all!  Lastly, there was no information in the chapter on care of clams that is not currently what passes for common knowledge in the hobby.  While this is fine, in the sense that a book can be usefully a compilation of common practices, I expected more.\n\nIn summary: a book that most interested hobbyists will find is worth owning, in spite of the fact that it falls short of a bar that has been set by recent books in the hobby, including Wilkerson's \"Clownfishes\", Borneman's \"Aquarium Corals\" and the three volumes of Delbeek and Sprung's \"The Reef Aquarium\".", "summary": "Good, but a bit overrated by other reviewers", "unixReviewTime": 1267488000}

He maintains his calm assertive self.\n\nCesar's corrections consist of a noise \"shhhh\" and a brief tug on the leash. Cesar works with the type of collar the owner has on the dog. That may be buckle, choke, martingale, or pinch/prong. None of Cesar's corrections are physically damaging to the dog. Incidentally, the prong/pinch collar is not a cruel device when used correctly. It is meant as a TRAINING AID, to be used for no more than 2 weeks to help gain control of larger dogs that need help mastering leash etiquette. A person should ALWAYS consult a professional trainer for information on the proper use of pinch/prong collars. Shock collars should never be used unless they are set on a \"beep\" only setting and under the supervision of a professional.\n\nPlease, if you own a dog, watch this show! This DVD set is filled with valuable information about canines and our relationship with them. Cesar gives good information in a no nonsense way that anyone can follow.

Bischoff", "reviewText": "Great DVD! I don't have cable so haven't been able to see the show that I have heard about until I bought the DVDs (I purchased seasons 1 and 2) at the same time. I absolutely love Cesar and just admire his ability! I have a puppy and have to keep watching these DVDs to see what I am doing wrong. Ugh... I only wish a couple of the episodes dealt directly with puppies. All the dogs in these DVDs are grown dogs that have bad habits and he comes in to rehabilitate the dogs and train the owners how to be pack leaders. Although I know it is harder to train a dog with bad habits than it is to train a puppy, puppies are just different and more like juvenile delinquents. Cesar can take any dog with any bad characteristics and within hours (or in the TV world \"within minutes\" is more accurate), you will see a completely different dog. He is just remarkable! Before a couple of episodes I have thought, \"How in the world will Cesar be able to address that problem?\" I have not seen a single problem that he hasn't been able to address.\n\nI try to use the same techniques on my puppy, but the key is consistency and frankly after a full day in the office, I often lack the energy to chase after him constantly. I guess it's my own fault if my puppy is a juvenile delinquent because the techniques that Cesar uses actually work. He emphasizes calm assertive energy, which works very well. If I yell at my puppy he either runs and hides under a table or he can get very rambunctious at times and barks at me as if he wants to fight it out - LOL. If I remain calm and assertive and use the techniques that Cesar teaches, my puppy will instantly change his behavior. The problem is that he isn't always at my side and if I see him chewing on something across the room I instantly yell at him to get him to stop the behavior. It works at the moment, but at the end of the day, he won't consider me his pack leader if I continue down that road. That is quite evident when he chooses to bark back at me. Pack leaders of dogs in the wild are always calm and in control.\n\nCesar is so educated on the topic of dogs I continue to learn something every time I watch an episode. I even watch them a second time because even though I got it the first time, I often don't follow though exactly as he does. Sometimes the little things make all the difference. Cesar is also very easy on the eyes and has a cute accent to go with it, which make the DVDs even that much more enjoyable if you're a woman. If our a man, you will have to be happy with just the learning portion of it :-)", "summary": "Cesar Rocks!", "unixReviewTime": 1406419200}
