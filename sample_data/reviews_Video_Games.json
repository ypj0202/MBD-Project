This is only the second first person shooter game that I have own. I think it is a lot of fun. Has good graphics and nice story line. It does take some skill to get through the levels. I think all players can enjoy this game. There are three levels to choose from based on your skill level.

You have to restock, and consider expenses... and you either win or you can loose the day, in business, depending on your decisions.
